                  the collected correspondence of Georg Henrik von Wright,
                  Wittgenstein’s friend and successor at Cambridge and one of
                  the three literary executors of Wittgenstein’s Nachlass. Among
                  von Wright’s correspondence partners, Elizabeth Anscombe and
                  Rush Rhees are of special interest to Wittgenstein scholars as
                  the two other trustees of the Wittgenstein papers. Thus, von
                  Wright’s collections held in Finland promise to shed light on
                  the context of decades of editorial work that made
                  Wittgenstein’s later philosophy available to all interested
                  readers. In this text, we present the letters which von Wright
                  received from Anscombe and Rhees during the first nine months
                  after Wittgenstein’s death. This correspondence provides a
                  vivid picture of the literary executors as persons and of
                  their developing relationships. The presented letters are
                  beautiful examples of what the correspondence as a whole has
                  to offer; it depicts – besides facts of editing – the story of
                  three philosophers, whose conversing voices unfold the human
                  aspects of inheriting Wittgenstein’s Nachlass. Their story
                  does not only deal with editing the papers of an eminent
                  philosopher, but with the attempt to do justice to the man
                  they knew, to his philosophy and to his wishes for
                  publication.},
