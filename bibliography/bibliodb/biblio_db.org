* Primary Sources
:DEFINITION:
A primary source provides direct or firsthand evidence about an event, object, person,
or work of art.

Primary sources are first-hand, authoritative accounts of an event, topic, or
historical time period. They are typically produced at the time of the event by a
person who experienced it, but can also be made later on in the form of personal
memoirs or oral histories.

Anything that contains original information on a topic is considered a primary source.
Usually, primary sources are the object discussed in your paper. For instance, if you
are writing an analysis on Upton Sinclairâ€™s The Jungle, the book would be a primary
source. But, just because a source is old does not mean it is a primary source.

                    Wittgensteinâ€™s friend and successor at Cambridge and one of
                    the three literary executors of Wittgensteinâ€™s Nachlass. Among
                    von Wrightâ€™s correspondence partners, Elizabeth Anscombe and
                    Rush Rhees are of special interest to Wittgenstein scholars as
                    the two other trustees of the Wittgenstein papers. Thus, von
                    Wrightâ€™s collections held in Finland promise to shed light on
                    the context of decades of editorial work that made
                    Wittgensteinâ€™s later philosophy available to all interested
                    readers. In this text, we present the letters which von Wright
                    received from Anscombe and Rhees during the first nine months
                    after Wittgensteinâ€™s death. This correspondence provides a
                    vivid picture of the literary executors as persons and of
                    their developing relationships. The presented letters are
                    beautiful examples of what the correspondence as a whole has
                    to offer; it depicts â€“ besides facts of editing â€“ the story of
                    three philosophers, whose conversing voices unfold the human
                    aspects of inheriting Wittgensteinâ€™s Nachlass. Their story
                    does not only deal with editing the papers of an eminent
                    philosopher, but with the attempt to do justice to the man
                    they knew, to his philosophy and to his wishes for
                    publication.},
