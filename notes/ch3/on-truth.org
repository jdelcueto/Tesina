* On Truth

-  To have the truth, to stand in the truth --what are these?
-  What did our Lord mean by calling /himself/ the truth?
-  "There is no such truth, there are only truths"
-  What are the things that have truth in them? Does creation? Do
   actions?
-  What does it mean that the good of practical reason is 'truth in
   agreement with right desire?
-  Do things made by men have truth in them?
-  What does it mean that at (or skill) is productive disposition with a
   true logos?
-  */What is the force of counting truth among 'trascendentals?/* >
   /trascendentals/ > (the things that run through all the categories >
   and all the special forms of things, > and don't belong each in one
   category)

** What is the primary bearer of truth?

-  People ask this and concentrate on a narrow range of possible
   answers: judgments, beliefs, etc...
-  Many would stop at statements or propositions as bearers of true
-  In theory of meaning these *classes* are obviously the ones most
   naturally thought of as containing the bearers of the predicate
   /"truth"/

** Anselm: what is true in a proposition

-  Is the 'res enunciata' the truth of the proposition? > /res
   enunciata/ -- the fact, the corresponding reality the true
   proposition tells

** what is the primacy of truth over falsehood?

Wittgenstein and Anselm are /Ã©pris/ with this question.

Wittgenstein: - 'the proposition has a sense which is independent of the
facts' - the proposition does not lose its meaning when the fact is no
more - meaning =/= truth

** How Anselm deals with the question about the primacy of truth

-  he asserts the question after answering it
-  He answers it by asking the pupil /what assertion is for/ > /for
   signifying that to be the case which is the case/ > pupil's account
   of truth: Nihil aliud scio nisi quia cum significat esse quod est,
   tunc est in ea veritas et est vera' > {/'I only know that when it
   signifies something's being so and it is so, truth is in it and it is
   true'/}
