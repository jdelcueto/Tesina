**** _Parmenides, Mystery and Contradiction_ (1969) :testimony:mystery:

**** +The New Theory of Forms (1966)+
**** +Understanding Proofs (1979)+
**** Aristotle and the Sea Battle (1956) :testimony:prophecy_miracles:
    - It is necessary: given an antiphasis about the present or the past, the
      affirmative proposition must be true or false; and similarly for the negative.
      + antiphasis :: a pair of propositions in which the same predicate is in one
                      affirmed, in the other denied, on the same subject
    - Aristotle's point is that "Either p or not p" is always necessary; *this
      necessity we are familiar with*.
    - What is a *novelty* is that when p describes a present or past situation, then
      either p is necessarily true, or ~p is necessarily true; and here "necessarily
      true" has a sense which is unfamiliar to us:
      + "necessarily true" is not simply the same as "true"
      + about something that would happen tomorrow, everyone would say: "there may be
        or may not"
      + we also say this about things which we don't know about the past and the
        present
      + does "may" express mere ignorance on our part in both cases?
      + logical necessity
**** +The Principle of Individuation (1953)+
**** Thought and Action in Aristotle: What is practical truth? (1965) :practical_truth:
     - The notion of truth or flasehood in action would quite generally be countered by
       the objection that "true" and "false" are senseles predicates as applied to what
       is done. If I am right there is philosophy to the contrary in Aristotle. And if,
       as I should maintain, the idea of descriptions under which what is done is
       voluntary is integral to his notion of action, then these predicates apply to
       actions stictly and properly, and not merely by an extension and in a way that
       ought to be explained away.
**** Necessity and Truth (1965) :necessarily_true:
     - The sorting out by Aquinas of the de re and the de dicto necessities confounded
       in 'what is known is necessarily true' is something a present-day English
       philosopher can appreciate.
**** _Hume and Julius Caesar_ (1973) :testimony:causality:reality_past:
     - But here it seems that she is arguing that the standard Humean
       foundationalist-evidentialist epistemology won't work, and also that coherentism
       won't work (at least if coherentism is supposed to imply that absolutely any
       belief we have can, in principle, be doubted and examined without threatening
       the whole structure of our web of beliefs). This is, at least for its time, a
       rather radical claim, since for a while it seemed that one must either be a
       foundationalist or a coherentist about epistemic justification. What is this
       third way that is needed to account for our knowledge of history (or
       justification of our beliefs regarding historical matters of fact)?
**** Whatever has a beginning... must have a cause (1974) :causality:
     - Hume gives an argument to show that a beginning of existence without a cause is
       not demonstrably absurd
       - It's an argument from imagination
       - we may grant the Parmenidean principle that "It is the same thing that can be
         thought and can be"
       - Hume's extension of it is certainly wrong
**** Will and Emotion (1978) :belief:practical_truth:
     - Will and emotion don't 'take' propositional objects, but involve desires which
       do; this Brentano got right in assimilating will and emotion
     - Anscombe opposes the assimilation
     - Belief is as it's objects are (p.103)
     - Is an error to assimilate will and emotion, a confusion of radically diferent
       kinds of thing, of elements in a flow of feelings with the voluntariness of an
       act. It's like identifying hunger with the voluntariness of eating.
     - There is an element of 'what for' present in the description of a voluntary act
       (will) that belongs to the intelligence of the agent.
     - It takes human intelligence to be an akolastos in Aristotle's sense and take an
       appetite and make it one's goal.
**** +Retractation (1965)+
**** _The Question of Linguistic Idealism (1976)_  :mystery:
     - This can be disproved but I still believe it is not an attitude of faith at all
***  II: Metaphysics and the Philosophy of the Mind
**** The Intentionality of Sensation, A Grammatical Feature :intentional_object:
     - Intentionality has been defined as a feature of certain verbs
     - An intentional object is the direct object of an intentional verb acting as an
       intentional verb
     - worship is an intentional verb
     - Just as 'direct object' is not the name of a kind of thing, neither is
       'intentional object' (since intentional objects are a species of direct objects)
     - An intentional object is given by a word or phrase which gives a description
       under which

**** Intention ??
**** Pretending ??
     - Contrast between mock performances, plain pretence, hypocrytical pretence
**** On the Grammar of Enjoy
     - Here she is interested in the characterization of predicative connection
     - non-predicative connection of words
     - what does the verb to enjoy take?
     - belief takes a proposition
     - I am saying that a predicative connection of expressions is just the sort of
       connection into which we introduce negative signs and quantifying applicatives,
       and which we combine with others by truth-connectives
     - Is she reevaluating predicative connection?

     - Those whose reactions show that for them the principle operates as an axiom
       appear either
       - to be making morality itself their substantive aim
       - testifying that there is a substantive good **
**** +On Brute facts+
     - Certain facts besides relations of ideas or statements of matter of fact
**** +Modern Moral Philosophy+
     - [Hume's] considerations constantly open up very deep and important problems
**** Authority in Morals
     - Be doers of the word and not hearers only
     - analogy: teaching morals like teaching mathematics
     - some truths about what is the case are revealed
**** War and Murder
     - It is not a vague faith in the triumph of the spirit over force, but a definite
       faith in the divine promises, that makes us believe that the church cannot fail.
**** +Mr Truman's Degree+
**** +The Justice of the present war examined+
**** +You can have sex without children+
**** Rules, Rights and promises
     - God himself can make no promises to man except in human language
     - Hume: Promises are naturally unintelligible, Anscombe: musts and cant's (as
       expressions of rules) are not naturally unintelligible, they can be understood
       by those of normal intelligence as they are trained in the practices of reason

so far i have spoken only of that use of the past tense in which a witness reports what
he has witnessed.
we also receive and use testimony, tell and hear stories, make deductions and guesses,
use unfullfilable past conditional sentences, express wishes about the past, make
historical statements and investigations.

If we were to describe the uses of words made in these cases, our descriptions would
all lack one particular feature. The descriptions would not in these cases include any
mention of actual events corresponding to the
