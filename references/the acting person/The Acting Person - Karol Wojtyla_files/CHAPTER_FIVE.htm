<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>INTEGRATION AND THE SOMA</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>1. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE PERSON'S INTEGRATION IN ACTION</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Integration as a Complementary Aspect of 
Transcendence</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The preceding two chapters have exhibited the human person in a 
dynamic specificity that manifests itself in and through the action. The 
essential moment in the action is that of self-determination, a point that we 
have already thoroughly examined and analyzed. Further, the performance of the 
action depends, as we have seen, on self-determination. That analysis of 
self-determination as well as of the performing of an action and the fulfillment 
this brings confirms our view of the person as a highly specific structure, 
namely, the structure of self-governance and self-possession. This structure 
differentiates the person from a merely natural being, for the elements of 
self-determination, of freedom, and of the consciousness of it, are wholly alien 
to nature as is also the transcendence in action formed within the person by his 
freedom and his conscious efficacy. It is that efficacy which is derived from 
freedom as the essential factor in the dynamic reality of the person and 
revealed by the experience of "man acts." The experience of being the agent, of 
being the actor, makes of acting the <I>action of the person </I>and 
distinguishes it from the other, numerous manifestations of the human dynamism, 
in which the moment of a conscious efficacy of the personal ego is lacking. The 
dynamic specificity of the action, the specificity molded by conscious efficacy 
and freedom, is brought into even greater prominence in contrast with all that 
which only "happens" in man as the subject.</P>
<P align=justify>The notion of the "transcendence of the person in the action" 
does not, however, exhaust all the contents of the dynamic reality of the 
person; and though through transcendence we perceive the structure of 
self-governance and self-possession as something specific to the human person 
and to his actions, this structure manifests what seems a characteristic duality 
or bipolarity of aspects. To observe the duality it suffices to look attentively 
at the content of the concepts of "self-governance" and "self-possession," which 
expose the dynamic reality of the person through and together with the action. 
The concept of "self-possession" denotes the person both as the one who 
possesses himself and as the one who is <I>in </I>the possession of himself. 
Similarly, the concept of "self-governance" denotes the person both as the one 
who governs himself and as the one who is in a way subjected and subordinate to 
himself. Thus the structures which articulate and grasp the dynamic reality of 
the person, also point to something other than the transcendence alone. For we 
call "transcendence" the aspect that consists in one's governance and possession 
of oneself and these are connected with self-determination, that is, with 
will.</P>
<P align=justify>There still remains the other aspect or the other pole of the 
structure we are considering here. He who governs himself is at the same time 
subjected and subordinate to himself. He who possesses himself is simultaneously 
<I>in </I>the possession of himself; to be in the possession and to be 
subordinate are elements of the same structure, of the same dynamic reality that 
is determined by the person and the action. These elements though strictly 
cohesive and intrinsically correlated with transcendence are not identical with 
it. It is because of them that the other aspect is exposed within the whole 
constituted by the dynamic structure of self-governance and self-possession and 
thus also within the structure of the human action. We define this aspect by the 
expression "the integration of the person in the action," which is complementary 
to the notion of the "transcendence of the person in the action." 
"Complementary" is to be understood here not only in the sense that integration 
complements transcendence and that they thus form a dynamic "person-action 
whole"; its meaning is still deeper in the sense that without integration 
transcendence remains, as it were, suspended in a kind of structural void. This 
becomes apparent in light of our analysis of self-governance and 
self-possession. For there is no governing of oneself without subjecting and 
subordinating oneself to this governance; neither is it p05sible to have 
<I>active </I>possession of oneself without a <I>passive </I>response in the 
dynamic structure of the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Integration as a Complex Unity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The concept of "integration" has thus emerged in our 
considerations from that fundamental vision which pervades all our previous 
analyses; it is also indicated by the concept of "transcendence." If we go even 
further back, the idea of integration emerges also from considerations of the 
efficacy and the subjectiveness of the human ego in his acting. Man experiences 
himself as the agent of his action and is thus its subject. He also has the 
experience of himself as the subject, but the experience of subjectiveness 
differs from that of efficacy. Moreover, the human being also experiences all 
that only happens in him. While in the experience of subjectiveness there is a 
certain passivity, the experience of efficacy - being intrinsically active 
-determines the human action. Nevertheless, every action contains a synthesis of 
the efficacy and the subjectiveness of the human ego. Insofar as efficacy may be 
viewed as the domain where transcendence manifests itself, integration is 
manifested in subjectiveness.</P>
<P align=justify>In this first approach to the notion of the "person's 
integration in the action" we shall endeavor to relate it essentially to our 
previous analyses of that dynamic reality which is constituted by the person and 
the action. The term "integration" is derived from the Latin adjective 
<I>integer </I>which means whole, complete, unimpaired. Thus "integration" 
points to a whole or the wholeness of a thing. "To integrate" means to assemble 
component parts so as to make a whole; thus integration denotes a process and 
its result. But in psychology and philosophy the term "integration" is used to 
denote the realization and the manifestation of a whole and a unity emerging on 
the basis of some complexity rather than the assembling into a whole of what was 
previously disconnected.</P>
<P align=justify>Our considerations have shown that it is in the latter sense 
that we should envisage the person as integrated in the process of action. A 
certain complexity in the structure of self-governance and self-possession 
manifested in and through the action, or, strictly speaking, in 
self-determination, is a characteristic and noteworthy trait of the person. 
Transcendence of the person is but one aspect of personal dynamism; it exposes 
but one of its poles. When it is accompanied by the subjective unity and 
wholeness of the structure of self-governance and self-possession, then it 
manifests the integration about which we are speaking. In the analysis of the 
dynamism of man, transcendence of experience passes into the immanence of the 
experience of acting itself: when I act, I am wholly engaged in my acting, in 
that dynamization of the ego to which my own efficacy has contributed.</P>
<P align=justify>The fact that "I am wholly engaged in my acting" cannot be 
explained by transcendence alone but requires for its interpretation also the 
integration of the person in the action.</P>
<P align=center>2. <B>THE INTEGRATION IN THE ACTION MANIFESTED IN 
DISINTEGRATION</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Many Meanings of "Disintegration"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The first and most important meaning we have been giving to 
"integration" in the course of our considerations refers, as already noted, to 
the intuition of the structure of the person which the person manifests in his 
dynamic characteristic. We are of course referring to the structures of 
self-governance and self-possession. It bears also upon another concept, that of 
"disintegration," which in psychology and philosophy denotes a lack of cohesion, 
a deficiency or defect of integration. We shall have to consider both of 
them.</P>
<P align=justify>"Disintegration" is a term used in various contexts and 
presumably with different meanings in those fields of learning which have the 
human being as their object. This applies to the different social and cultural 
domains of human activities as well as to the human person. Disintegration is 
most often considered by those disciplines that are interested in the 
psychological aspect of the personality of man and identify disintegration with 
everything that in some way departs from or fails to attain to ordinary human 
standards. In this approach the integrated man is seen as simply the standard or 
"normal" man and the disintegrated man is sub- or abnormal. The question may 
well be asked what in these disciplines is regarded as "normal" or accepted as 
the standard of human normality. It seems that in most cases the standard is 
established intuitively; common sense discloses which man is normal and which 
one is not quite or not at all normal.</P>
<P align=justify>Using this intuitive standard the disciplines engaged in the 
study of human personalities have thoroughly examined and defined the different 
symptoms of disintegration each within its own peculiar dimensions. These 
dimensions are contained in the notion of "psychological personality," of which 
man's moral personality forms an intrinsic part. We know that the experience of 
morality is an indispensable component of the integral experience of man and 
that as such it plays a crucial role in understanding man as the person, 
especially in understanding the dynamic conception of man. In fact, the notion 
of "disintegration," as it is used in the human sciences, not excluding medicine 
or empirical psychiatry, very often relies upon facts that have an essentially 
ethical nature.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Disintegration as a Structural Defect of Self-Governance and 
Self-Possession</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Apparently the most important implications of the psychic 
phenomenon of disintegration are to be found already in the current as well as 
scientific uses of the term. However, in any branch of science dealing with man, 
the meaning of "disintegration" is corollary to the meaning of "integration." 
Now, the fundamental significance of "integration" - it always in one way or 
another consists in the person's integration in the action - is strictly 
connected with the person's intrinsic structure of self-governance and 
self-possession. The structure is essential for the very being of the person as 
actualized in the action; it is its manifestation. What we call the 
"psychological" or the "moral (ethical)" personality is derivative, something 
secondary with respect to being a person as such; in a sense, it is but an 
aspect of "being a person." "Integration" in its principal sense and this 
applies also to "disintegration" - has to be considered with respect to the 
fundamental structure and not only as concerning the derivative structures, even 
though both terms also apply to the derivative structures. Indeed, it is only 
insofar as they relate to the fundamental structure that they apply also to the 
particular manifestations in the psycho-ethical dimension or psychosomatic 
dimension of man.</P>
<P align=justify>"Disintegration" in its fundamental sense signifies what in the 
structure of self-governance and self-possession of the person appears as a 
defect or a failing. The lower limit of disintegration is set by all the 
symptoms that reflect what is in fact a total absence of self-governance and 
self-possession. In this condition the creature, that is, a man and hence 
ontologically a person, is, or at least appears to be, completely destitute of 
the specifically "personal" structures manifested in and with the action; 
indeed, this condition consists in the disintegration of the person in the 
action. Such states of deep or complete disintegration, which are well known and 
have their particular scientific denotations, fall under various psycho-medical 
classifications. Since our objective is to grasp the meaning of "disintegration" 
in its fundamental sense rather than to provide a description of phenomena, 
these facts are mentioned here only as an illustration of our argument. 
Important here is the fundamental sense of "disintegration" which is, as already 
noted, connected with the dynamic structure of the person. Since the structure 
is essentially formed by self-determination, disintegration refers to 
self-determination. While self-determination means that man can govern himself 
and possess himself, disintegration on the contrary, signifies a more or less 
deep-seated inability to govern, or to possess, oneself.</P>
<P align=justify>The ability to govern, or to possess, oneself so strictly 
connected with self-determination, establishes - as we know from our previous 
discussion - the transcendent backbone of the human person. In some respects and 
in some cases disintegration may be considered as a collapse of this backbone, 
though even then it does not contradict or destroy the transcendence itself of 
the person in the action. A disintegrated person is incapable of governing, or 
of possessing, himself to the extent that this inability prevents him from 
subordinating himself and thus from remaining in possession of himself.<SUP>61 
</SUP>He is characterized, so to speak, by an insubordinative and unpossessible 
ego and not by a straightforward abolition or limitation of the transcendent 
ego. The defects and defaults of integration become, however, the defects and 
defaults of transcendence; a fact clearly apparent when we keep in mind that 
transcendence and integration are two complementary aspects of the same dynamic 
person-action reality.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Disintegration Reveals the Significance of the Person's 
Integration in the Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In disintegration there are more than a few peculiar symptoms 
and forms, which are the task of the particular branches of science to classify 
and qualify; disintegration also manifests different degrees of intensity. These 
degrees or stages correspond to the dynamic vision of man that has been 
developed by Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy. In its perspective we may 
distinguish three stages of disintegration: the actual, the habitual, and the 
"potential" (understanding disintegration itself as referring to the capacity of 
man). There is obviously a difference between, for example, a separate instance 
of not associating somebody's face or appearance with his name and the frequent 
or regular failure to associate the one with the other. The latter may have 
different causes. If we assume, however, that the failure to associate a 
person's name with his appearance is a symptom of disintegration, then a single, 
actual instance of such a failure corresponds to a lesser degree of 
disintegration than when it occurs regularly, that is to say, habitually. Yet 
another difference occurs between the habitual failure to associate a name with 
a face and a total inability to make this association correctly, for in the 
latter case we are dealing with man's capacity itself, that is, we touch upon 
the defects of this capacity.</P>
<P align=justify>There are innumerable examples that would illustrate more 
vividly that essential trait of disintegration which consists in the 
"insubordinativeness" or "unpossessibility" of the subjective ego. But this 
trait is noticeable also in our example because the inability to make correct 
associations is an essential basic defect of cognition itself which has its 
consequences in acting. An incapacity to correctly associate does not allow one 
to make correct choices and decisions; also, the self-determination of the 
person will be defective in one way or another, and the more serious this defect 
is the more strongly will it affect the person himself and the harder will it 
bear on the person's structures of self-governance and self-possession. We know 
from the observation of mental cases the tragic consequences of an incapacity to 
make correct associations.</P>
<P align=justify>In this way the concept of "disintegration" allows us a better 
insight into the fundamental significance of integration, as the aspect of the 
person's dynamic reality.</P><B>
<P align=center>3. THE PERSON'S INTEGRATION IN THE ACTION IS THE KEY TO THE 
UNDERSTANDING OF MAN'S PSYCHOSOMATIC UNITY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Psychosomatic Unity and the Integration of the Acting 
Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The crucial problem for understanding man's dynamic reality is 
to establish the fundamental significance of the integration and disintegration 
of the acting person. Very often man is defined as a psycho-physical unity and 
it is then assumed that this notion is sufficient to define and express 
adequately his essence. But in fact the notion expresses only everything that is 
accessible to the particular empirical sciences; all that makes man to be a 
person and allows him to realize himself as the person in the action undergoes, 
in this approach, a specific reduction. It is precisely the reason why in this 
study, in which we are trying to trace step by step the experience of the 
dynamic reality of the acting person, we have to abandon this approach and 
change drastically our way of looking at the problem.</P>
<P align=justify>An interpretation of the fundamental significance of 
integration as well as of disintegration may serve as a key to our point of 
view. In the light of the total experience of man the view that he is a 
psycho-physical entity presupposes the concept of the "person" who manifests 
himself first of all in action. It thus presupposes a comprehensive 
interpretation of the experience of "man acts" in which transcendence and 
integration are considered as mutually complementary aspects. It is only within 
the framework of that dynamic unity which is constituted by the person in the 
action that man can be seen as a psycho-physical unity.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Person-Action Unity Has Precedence over the Psychosomatic 
Complexity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Such is the case especially with integration. This is clearly 
indicated by the fundamental significance of the integration as well as of 
disintegration of the acting person. The subordination of the subjective ego to 
the transcendent ego - that is to say, the synthesis of efficacy and 
subjectiveness - in itself implies the complexity as well as the unity of man as 
a psycho-physical entity. It seems, however, for reasons which will be discussed 
later, that the term "psychosomatic" is here more appropriate than 
"psycho-physical."</P>
<P align=justify>The subordination of the subjective ego to the transcendent ego 
also includes both the psychosomatic complexity and unity of man. The same 
applies to the integration of elements and functions within the structure of 
self-possession. An analysis of integration imposes, on the one hand, the 
necessity of assuming the existence of these personal structures - this we have 
already done - but on the other hand, it also makes absolutely necessary an 
insight into the psychosomatic complexity of man. This complexity has here a 
special importance because ultimately man owes his psychosomatic unity to the 
integration as well as to the transcendence of the person in the action. This 
insight does not receive adequate or sufficient prominence in interpretations 
conducted solely along the lines of inductive thinking characteristic of 
empirical sciences.</P>
<P align=justify>The crucial fact in the total experience of man is that it is 
in action that the whole psychosomatic complexity develops into the specific 
person-action unity. This unity has precedence relatively to both that 
complexity and the psycho-physical unity, if the psychosomatic unity is 
understood as a kind of sum total of the somatic and the psychical as well as of 
their appropriate natural dynamisms. Action comprises the multiplicity and 
diversity of the dynamisms that belong to the soma and to the psyche. In 
relation to them action constitutes that superior dynamic unity. This is, in 
fact, what the integration of the person in the action - as the complementary 
aspect of transcendence - consists in; for the human action is more than a sum 
of those other dynamisms; it is <I>a new and superior type of dynamism, </I>from 
which the others receive a new meaning and a new quality that is properly 
<I>personal. </I>They do not possess this meaning and this quality on their own 
account and, insofar as they are but the natural dynamisms of the psyche and the 
soma, they attain these only in the <I>action of the person.</P></I>
<P align=justify>Consequently we may say that only the person's integration in 
the action justifies an insight into the elements of that natural dynamic 
multiplicity constituting the psychosomatic totality of man. This insight allows 
us to construct an image of man as a psychosomatic unity. But as the image 
presupposes that more fundamental view of the person-action unity which is given 
in the experience of "man acts" it also draws from this experience its features 
and significance. The notion of the "person's integration in the action" 
supplies, in fact, the key to this significance.</P>
<P align=justify>There are indeed various dynamisms of man at both the psychical 
and the somatic levels that take part in human action.<SUP>62 </SUP>In every 
action these dynamisms are "blended" together, but blending implies forming a 
whole from more or less homogeneous elements, and this is not the case with 
action. What does actually happen has more import; the dynamisms of the psyche 
and the soma take an active part in integration, not at their own levels but 
<I>at the level of the person. </I>By being the complementary aspect of 
transcendence, integration of the person in the action allows the realization of 
the person's structure of self-governance and self-possession. Thus also in this 
case integration means introduction to a higher level of unity than that 
indicated in the expression "psychosomatic unity" taken in its empirical 
sense.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Integration Introduces Psychosomatic Activations into the 
Dynamic Unity of Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>At this higher level of the person-action unity the dynamism 
belonging to man's psyche and soma seem to disappear. They fuse together. This 
does not mean, however, that they cease to be in some way distinct. On the 
contrary, they continue to exist in their own right and essentially co-create 
the dynamic reality of the person's action. In every particular case the manner 
of their participation is different depending on the individual character of the 
action. For instance, when an action involves a definite movement of the body as 
the visible element of its individual character, then the somatic dynamisms, 
without which the movement would be impossible, collaborate to produce the 
action. On the other hand, we know from experience that when the action is 
wholly internal and consists, let us say, in making the final decision on some 
important issue, then the different psychical dynamisms of an emotional nature 
play their role in the individual character of the action and determine its 
concrete form.</P>
<P align=justify>We saw in our earlier analyses that these dynamisms are not as 
such an "acting"; they are rather to be identified with the experience of 
"something-happens-in-man" and not with that of "man-acts." A close examination 
of the dynamic elements in man's psychosomatic complexity allows an analysis of 
the diverse "happenings" or of what we then called the various "activations," 
this term being used both by analogy and in opposition to the action, which 
alone corresponds to the experience of "man-acts." At the same time the person's 
integration in the action introduces the various activations of the 
psychosomatic structure of man into the action. In the action they reach a new 
and superior unity, in which they play an active part, but apart from action, 
when they are only the dynamisms of the soma or the psyche, they only "happen" 
in the man-subject. The function of integration consists in this overstepping of 
the dividing line between what only "happens" and "acting."</P>
<P align=justify>The integrating function is necessary to bring about, in and 
through the action, the personal structure of self-governance and 
self-determination. Without the integration function taking place in action only 
man's subjectivity would be realized in his ontic basis, but not his efficacy. 
We know from experience, however, that it is efficacy that dominates in the 
ontic structure of man. Efficacy and the freedom that we discover in this 
experience as the constitutive elements of the action draw all the 
psycho-physical dynamism into that unity in which the ego becomes for itself the 
first object of its acting. Owing to integration these dynamisms play an active 
role in self-determination, that is, in making the human person's freedom 
emerge.</P>
<DIR><B>
<P align=justify>4. THE INTEGRATION AND THE "INTEGRITY" OF MAN ON THE BASIS OF 
INTERACTING PSYCHOSOMATIC CONDITIONINGS</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></DIR><I>
<P align=justify>The Fundamentals of Man's Psychical and Somatic 
Dynamisms</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The aspect of integration in the analysis of the person and the 
action is, as stated above, strictly connected with the need for a deeper 
insight into the psychosomatic complexity of man and into the complexity of the 
dynamisms of both his somatic and his psychical aspects. In this respect our 
investigations must come very close to the particular sciences that see man - 
his body and his psyche - as an independent epistemological object. The 
knowledge obtained by them serves various practical applications concerning man 
as a psychophysical being. In particular, it is to be found in medicine with its 
many specialized fields. Our investigations into the integration of the person 
in the action come close to the specialized sciences but can never be identified 
with them; the reason is, of course, the previously mentioned difference in the 
specific way of looking at the object of study.</P>
<P align=justify>Thus the aim of our subsequent analyses is not to gain insight 
into the dynamisms of man's psychosomatic complexity of the type pursued by the 
particular sciences. First, because the particular sciences are very much 
concerned with details, which would lead us away from viewing our object, 
namely, the person-action relation as a whole. Second, they seem to be 
preoccupied in investigating the different psychical and somatic dynamisms as 
such and, as it were, for their own sake. In doing so they overlook that 
specific personal totality which is essential to our approach. Our investigation 
into the dynamisms appropriate to the psyche and the soma of the human being 
will in contrast deal mainly with the essentials of these dynamisms, and with 
the characteristic nature the dynamisms assume because of their integration in 
the person's action. Our description can neither depart from the data supplied 
by the particular sciences nor be in any way inconsistent with them, nor can it 
accept their reliance on minute details and the methods they employ. We thus see 
what is to be in principle our characteristic of the psychosomatic dynamism of 
man, to whom we attribute <I>reactivity </I>as well as <I>emotivity, </I>the 
former corresponding more to the soma and the latter to the psyche.</P>
<P align=justify>We must here emphasize that trait of the dynamism which 
determines its inner content and makes possible its unity (or integration). Man 
in his psychosomatic complexity constitutes a highly diversified manifold, the 
particular elements of which are strictly interrelated, in such a way that they 
mutually condition each other and depend on each other. The most important of 
these interrelations is the conditioning of the psychical by the somatic, the 
dependence of the dynamism appropriate to the psyche on the soma.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Outerness and Innerness of the Human Body</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>When speaking of the somatic element we refer to the human 
body, first in the current prescientific sense and then in the sense the term 
has in its scientific usage. The body is material, it is a visible reality, 
which is accessible to sense; the access to it is first of all from the 
"outside." The outer shape of the human body determines in the first place what 
is visible in man, it decisively affects his individual appearance and the 
definite impression that he makes. So conceived, the human body is composed of 
different members, each of which has its place and performs its proper function. 
For the moment we are considering only the functions "outwardly" discernible. In 
this way the human body forms outwardly a whole that is membered in a specific 
manner appropriate to man alone. This applies not only to the special 
distribution of bodily members but also to their mutual coordination in the 
whole of man's outward form. The noun "shape" has its corresponding adjective 
"shapely," which qualifies man from the point of view of the arrangement and the 
coordinations of the members forming his body.</P>
<P align=justify>This outwardly discernible entirety, however, by no means 
accounts for all the reality constituting the human body, just as it does not in 
the case of the animal body or of plants. The body has, in fact, simultaneously 
its own particular inwardness; on account of this inwardness we speak of the 
human organism. While the complexity is outwardly reflected by the diversity and 
the mutual coordination of bodily members, its inward reflection is in the 
diversity and the mutual coordination of the bodily organs. The organs determine 
that vitality or dynamism of the body which has somatic virtuality as its 
counterpart. The term "somatic" refers to the body in the outer as well as the 
inner aspects of the system; thus when we speak of somatic dynamism we refer 
both to the outer reality of the body with its appropriate members and to its 
inner reality, that is, the organism: to the system and the joint functioning of 
all the bodily organs.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Principle of Man's Psychosomatic Integrity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The somatic side of man and his psychical side are strictly 
interrelated, the relation between them consisting in the fact that the 
psychical functions are conditioned by the sum total of the somatic functions 
and especially by some particular somatic functions. The term "psyche" applies 
to the soul, though not immediately in the metaphysical sense; its first 
application is in a "physical," or phenomenal, sense. Thus "psyche" and 
"psychical" apply to the whole range of manifestations of the integral human 
life that are not in themselves bodily or material, but at the same time show 
some dependence on the body, some somatic conditioning. For instance eyesight, 
feelings, emotions are not in themselves corporeal, but they show a measure of 
dependence on and a connection with the body. The important sphere of psychical 
facts is not difficult to distinguish and isolate from the total dynamism of 
man; but when distinguishing the psychical from the somatic, from what in itself 
is corporeal, it is also impossible not to notice how strictly it is related to 
and conditioned by the soma, by the body as an organism. The recognition of the 
differences as well as of the interrelations dates as far back in the history of 
human knowledge as does anthropology itself. In this respect we have profited 
most from the philosophy of Aristotle and his realistic approach to the physical 
world, the approach that gave a different basis to the metaphysics and the 
anthropology of the Stagirite than did Plato's attitude toward the world.</P>
<P align=justify>The person's integration in the action rests on the 
conditioning of the psychical by the somatic; it is from this conditioning that 
man's integrity is derived. This integrity is not limited solely to the presence 
in him of all the elements from the somatic and the psychical sphere, but it 
also entails a system of their interrelations and <I>mutual conditioning 
</I>that allow the functioning of each sphere in the specifically human manner. 
Thus the integration of man is not static; on the contrary, its nature is 
dynamic. As to the direction of these conditionings we see that in a way they 
operate from the outside and are directed inward (in the case of psychical 
functions conditioned by the somatic ones), and from the inside outward (in the 
case of the somatic expression of psychical functions). Psychology, or rather 
the Aristotelian-Thomistic anthropology, distinguishes in the former of these 
directions two alternatives: the somatic conditioning of psychical functions may 
be either internal (as is the case with all sense functions) or solely external 
(as are conditioned somatically by man's spiritual functions). This is so 
because spiritual functions are seen as remaining internally independent from 
matter. The integrity of man is, in the empirical sense, verified dynamically by 
the correct operation of functions, and this depends on the conditionings in 
general of what is psychical by the somatic and - in the direction of expression 
- of what is somatic by the psychical. The person's integration in the action is 
based upon this <I>dynamic totality, </I>while any defects in this domain we 
characterize as <I>disintegration.</P>
<P align=center>5. </I><B>THE PERSON AND THE BODY</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Reminiscences of Hylomorphism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It seems that we have now satisfied all the necessary 
preliminary conditions for embarking upon the discussion of the person and the 
body; in a sense we have already begun our investigation. Moreover, there is 
apparently no danger of so isolating the body and its role in the dynamic whole 
of the acting person as to risk attributing an absolute significance to this one 
aspect. Obviously, we cannot discuss the human body apart from the <I>whole that 
is man, that is, without recognizing that he is a person. </I>Neither can we 
examine the dynamisms and potentialities proper to the human body without 
understanding the essentials of action and of its specifically personal 
character. In this connection it seems appropriate to recall the vision of the 
human reality advanced in the traditional philosophy of Aristotle and Aquinas, 
which from the likeness of man to the other beings of the visible world 
discovers in him alongside of the hylic or material element also the element of 
<I>morphe </I>or form; hence the theory of hylomorphism and the analysis of the 
human being carried out within its frame. To accept the general principles of 
this vision, however, does not ~'mply that we intend to repeat once again the 
formulations of the hylomorphic doctrine. So far all our discussions have 
reflected clearly enough the effort to rethink anew the dynamic human reality in 
terms of the reality of the acting person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Somatic Constitution and the Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>To begin, the problem of the body in its strict relation to the 
human person may as well be considered in a somewhat static approach. Its 
relation to the human person is absolutely necessary, so much so that it is 
contained even in that often used definition which sees man as a rational 
animal; in this definition "animal" denotes the body as well as corporality. It 
is the body that gives man his concreteness (this fact is in a way reflected in 
the classic metaphysical doctrine of man's individualization by matter). At any 
rate, this is so in the external experience, which allows us to grasp what is 
visible in man; we may equate here the "visible" with the "external." Man 
manifests himself - even from the static point of view - through his body, its 
specific, strictly individual build. The term sometimes used in this connection 
is "constitution," but it does not coincide exactly with the externally visible 
build of the body and seems to extend also to the internal system of bodily 
organs, which accompanies and, indeed, determines the external somatic whole. 
The notion of "constitution" includes not only the external shape of the body 
but also the dynamic system of the internal organic and structural factors that 
contribute to this shape. Although apparent already in the static approach, the 
constitutive trait of man reaches also to his dynamic aspects; it is manifest in 
the mobility that is characteristic for all human beings. Mobility is externally 
manifest and even from observing it we may infer certain differences between 
people. These differences have from ancient times inspired anthropologists with 
the idea of constitutive resemblances, of certain, somatically distinguishable, 
human types. Moreover, in relation to what was said previously about the human 
psyche being conditioned by the soma, these resemblances and human types also 
apply to the psyche. Hence the whole problem of temperaments, which has 
persisted throughout the history of anthropology from Aristotle to our 
days.<SUP>63</P></SUP><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Human Body as the Person's Means of Expression</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have thus passed from the static image of man formed by the 
body to his dynamism. The anthropological knowledge is in this respect 
extensive, detailed, and highly ramified. But when we want to define the 
relations between the body and the person, everybody - not excluding the mate 
rialists - seems to agree that the problem lies essentially in finding out what 
exactly are the links between man's visible outwardness and his invisible 
inwardness. We are not concerned here solely with what is "contained inside" the 
body itself, that is, with the organism as the somatic foundation of the 
constitution. It is generally recognized that the human body is in its visible 
dynamism the territory where, or in a way even the medium whereby, the person 
expresses himself. Strictly speaking, the personal structure of self-governance 
and self-possession may be thought of as "traversing" the body and being 
expressed by the body. We already know that this structure manifests itself in 
action and is realized through action. It is intimately connected with the 
person's specific power of self-determination exercised through choice and 
decision, which establishes the dynamic subordination to truth. In this way the 
dynamic transcendence of the person - spiritual by its very nature - finds in 
the human body the territory and the means of expression. This is confirmed time 
and again by the actions, visible or at least perceptible manifestations of 
self-determination - that is, of the person's efficacy - in and by the body. In 
this sense, the body is the territory and in a way the means for the performance 
of action and consequently for the fulfillment of the person.</P>
<P align=justify>This common manifestation of the person's integration in the 
action, that may be thought of as "traversing" the body and being expressed in 
it, provides perhaps the simplest demonstration of the way the body belongs and 
is subordinate to the person. The problem of the relation between "body and 
soul" has been the theme of countless speculations and theories beginning with 
Plato, who conceived of man as a spiritual substance endowed with a material 
body for his terrestrial existence, and Aristotle, whose position was that of 
the "substantial unity" of soul and body (that is, of form and matter) within 
the individual human being. In our present discussion the problem is for the 
time being envisaged only from the point of view of expression. It thus also 
becomes - conformably to what was said in the conclusion to the analysis of the 
person's transcendence in the action - the territory and the means for the 
manifestation of the soul, of the specific dynamism of its spiritual nature, and 
of freedom in its dynamic relation to truth. The integration of the person in 
the action, taking place in the body and expressed by it, reveals simultaneously 
the deepest sense of the integrity of man as a person. It is the soul, indeed 
the spiritual soul, that appears to be the ultimate principle of this integrity. 
The person is not to be identified solely with the body as such. It seems that 
even behaviorists never go so far as to posit such an identity, all the more so 
as in their psychology they are preoccupied only with the external 
"manifestations" of man and do not seek any "inner" understanding. Behaviorism 
may serve as a descriptive approach to action but not as a method of 
interpreting man's acting.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Man-Person Has and Uses His Body when Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The fact of the externalization of the person in and by the 
body, which takes place first of all in the action, has as its consequence the 
moment of objectification already discussed in Chapter 3. The person becomes the 
object of his own acting. In this objectification the body participates in a 
special manner. Whenever the person externalizes himself by means of the body he 
becomes simultaneously the object of his acting. The objectification of the body 
then becomes an integral element in the objectification of the whole personal 
subject, to whom the body "belongs" and of whose subjectivity it forms a 
structural part. The body is not a member of the subjective ego in the way of 
being identical with the ego; man <I>is not </I>the body, he only <I>has 
</I>it.~ To "have" his own body leads to its objectification in actions and at 
the same time it is in this objectification that it expresses itself. Man has 
his body in a special way and also in a special way he is aware of his 
"possession," when in his acting he employs <I>his </I>body as a compliant tool 
to express his self-determination.</P>
<P align=justify>Such a compliance of the body also serves to attain the 
integration of the person in the action. The ability to objectify the body and 
to employ it in acting is an important factor of the personal freedom of man. It 
is through this somatic moment - and also somatic factor - in the personal 
subjectification that the specific structure of self-governance and 
self-possession of the human person is accomplished and manifested. Man as the 
person "possesses himself" in the experience of his embodiment precisely because 
it entails the feeling of possessing his body, and he governs himself because he 
controls his body. It is to this extent that the relation of the person to the 
body becomes "externally" apparent in the action of the person. This has various 
important implications in the psychology of acting and in ethics.</P>

<P align=center>6. <B>THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PERSON AND THE REACTIVITY OF 
THE BODY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Dynamism of the Body and the Total Dynamism of 
Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The external experience does not, however, account fully for 
the relation that exists between the body and the person, in particular insofar 
as his acting, or the action, is concerned. The experience has to take us, so to 
speak, to the interior of the body, so as to allow us to feel its own 
inwardness. It is only then that the relation is seen more completely and its 
image becomes more mature. Our earlier analyses have prepared us to make a clear 
distinction between an insight into the person, who is man, and an insight into 
the interior of the human body; for the body, as we have already noted, has its 
own, purely somatic inwardness. But it is not this inwardness that we have in 
mind when we refer to the human body (and also that of animals) as an organism. 
The human body in its inwardness has a purely somatic dynamism of its own, on 
which the external dynamism of the body, its purely natural mobility depends; 
the two dynamisms in nowise prevent the human body from serving as means for the 
person's expressing himself in his actions. Now we have only to look into the 
purely somatic inner dynamism in order to grasp and understand more precisely 
the integration of the person in the action. This integration depends in the 
first place on the somatic organization of man, in which the somatic dynamism is 
an important if not the decisive element; we may say that it is the dynamism of 
the body as such.</P>
<P align=justify>Is it at all possible to distinguish this dynamism? It seems 
that in view of the generally accepted distinction between the body and the 
soul, or even more so between the somatic and the psychical, such a distinction 
is possible. But the discrimination of the somatic dynamism in the whole of the 
human dynamism presents a task that demands a high level of cognitive precision. 
These high standards are required from those who investigate the body itself as 
well as from those who with the methods of the particular sciences study the 
human psyche or at still another level of abstraction endeavor to define more 
accurately the nature of the soul and of its proper relation to the body. Our 
investigations into the human person cannot avoid dealing with this last 
problem, which has always been one of the most difficult in the history of human 
thought. Admittedly, it is not the aim of this study to involve itself in 
questions concerning the nature of the soul and its relation to the body; but in 
the course of an analysis of the acting person these questions arise and have to 
be considered.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Reactivity of the Somatic Dynamism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>At this stage of our considerations we are not concerned with 
that kind of knowledge of the human body which is the subject of investigation 
of the particular sciences but with certain characteristic aspects of the body. 
The starting point in this approach is the assertion that, because of his body, 
the man-person genuinely belongs to nature. This implies, on the one hand, his 
similarity to the rest of nature and, on the other, his partaking in the whole 
of the external conditions of existence that we also refer to as "nature." Man's 
position in nature comes closest to animals, in particular the so-called higher 
animals. The previously mentioned classic definition of man as rational animal 
contains a fundamental assertion about human nature, it is constantly being 
confirmed in the field of natural sciences and lies at the origin of the 
well-known evolutionary theory of the origin of man. These questions, however, 
have but a secondary bearing on our argument and there is no need to examine 
them here.</P>
<P align=justify>However, the close connection existing between the human 
organism and nature, so far as nature constitutes the set of conditions of 
existence and life, helps us to define the somatic dynamism of man. It seems 
that this dynamism may be contained and expressed in the concept of "reactivity" 
and also by the attribute <I>reactive. </I>"Reactivity" would refer to the human 
body as such. The purely somatic dynamism of man can be viewed as being 
"reactive," and we may also speak of the potentiality lying at its roots as 
reactive.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Why Can the Somatic Dynamism Be Called </I>Reactive?</P></b>
<P align=justify>The human body has the ability to react like other bodies in 
nature. The notion of "reaction" is often used with reference to the whole 
pattern of human behavior; it is what we have in mind when we say someone 
reacted in such-and-such a manner to a piece of news, though in so saying we are 
not referring to the somatic reaction but to the psychical reaction that 
expresses itself in a definite emotion and is thus an "emotive reaction." But 
the colloquial "to react" often implies something more than just an emotive 
response; it may often denote a choice or decision and hence a definite response 
of the will to a presented value. There is no doubt that the term "reaction" can 
be adequately applied to various obviously differentiated components of human 
behavior and modes of acting. This indicates that the somato-reactive element is 
very deeply rooted in all human acting.</P>
<P align=justify>The reason why we are here restricting the use of the term 
"reactivity" to the soma, that is, to the dynamism of the body alone, lies in 
the direct connections of the body itself with nature; the psychical and emotive 
factors are only indirectly connected with nature by means of the soma and its 
somatic dynamism. In the notion of "reaction" there is of course presupposed the 
notion of some action or acting that has its source and its cause in nature 
viewed as the set of factors conditioning the existence and the activity (i.e., 
reactivity) of the human body. The ability to react is apparent already in 
inanimate bodies (e.g., the ability to expand under the influence of heat or 
contract in the cold). A comparable ability is observed in animate creatures, 
but their reactivity is manifested at the level of life. While the study of the 
reactivity at the level of inanimate beings is the task of physics or chemistry, 
at the level of animate creatures it belongs to biology. We find that reactivity 
is at that level a manifestation of life and to some extent even its principle, 
that is to say, the principle of formation, subsistence, and development. It is 
also the distinctive feature expressing man's somatic virtualities and 
consequently his bodily vitality. Hence, within its frame we have to attempt to 
trace the manifestations of the somatic dynamism, that is, the reactions of the 
body that constitute the body's own vitality.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation between Reactivity and Vitality of the Human 
Body</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The vitality of the human body is of an essentially vegetative 
nature; the life of the body itself is vegetative. In fact, the vegetation of a 
human being begins with conception and ends with death. The external conditions 
of the body's vegetation are similar to those of the vegetation of other bodies; 
they are determined by the natural environment - the climate, the atmosphere - 
and the food and drink as the means of vegetative process and regeneration. The 
body as an organism is by nature, that is to say, by the power of its innate 
endowment, adapted to vegetation and reproduction. Reproduction is made possible 
by the sexual differentiation of the human body, by those of its organs which 
physically enable the conception of man, his development until the moment of his 
entrance into the world, and finally his birth to a biologically autonomous 
life. The dynamic fabric of all the vegetative vitality of the human body 
consists of a sequence of purely instinctive reactions, that is, reactions that 
follow the way of nature itself. These reactions take place, that is to say, 
they happen, in the person without any special influence of the will, without 
participation in the person's self-determination. Consequently, they happen in 
the person but they are not the acting of the person, they do not constitute his 
action. The body activates itself according to the inner design and purpose of 
vegetation and reproduction; the character of this activation of the human body 
is reactive.</P>
<P align=justify>In this case "reactivity" denotes an instinctive and dynamic 
relation to nature conceived as a definite biological "environment," as a system 
conditioning both vegetation and reproduction. The relation is purposeful 
inasmuch as the particular, instinctive somatic reactions have as their object 
either vegetation or reproduction.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point we are already entering upon the question of the 
so-called instincts, which we consider below. The ability to react to stimuli is 
a particular feature of man's somatic system. This ability de erves special 
attention inasmuch as it imparts a specifically active character to the 
reactivity of the human body. The active nature of the body's reactivity in 
response to stimuli is clearly apparent when contrasted with the passive 
submissiveness of the body to the influence of external conditions insofar as 
its physico-chemical functioning is concerned. In the human organism the ability 
to react to stimuli is directly related to the nervous system, which serves the 
whole body and determines the particular directions of its reactive dynamism as 
well as of the somatic virtualities lying at its roots.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>7. ACTION AND MOTION</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Meaning of the Body's Subjectivity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>As we have indicated, the dynamism of the human body as such 
does not depend on the self-determination of the person. It is instinctive and 
spontaneous. The body as an organism constitutes its dynamic source, that is, 
its effective cause; the will is not its cause, for the dynamism of the body 
does not proceed from the person's self-determination. This is why we do not 
disclose it directly and immediately in the experience "man-acts," which reveals 
the efficacy of the person, but it is to be found in the experience 
"somethinghappens-in-man," where the efficacy of the person is absent. In 
reaction and reactivity the person's efficacy does not enter; we may then only 
speak of some kind of efficacy of the body and pertaining to the person only on 
behalf of the ontic unity of man. Moreover, the fact that the body's efficacy 
differs experientially from the efficacy of the person brings sharply into 
evidence the ontic complexity of man. We shall see presently that this 
complexity cannot be wholly comprised in the conception of a psycho-physical or 
psychosomatic being.</P>
<P align=justify>It is because of the autonomy of the body with its instinctive 
dynamism with respect to the self-determination of the person that in the 
totality of the personal structure of man his body is in a way a basis, an 
underlayer, or a substructure for what determines the structure of the person; 
of course the substructure itself forms part of the unity of the human being and 
thus of the unity of the person. What is more, in view of internal bonds and 
mutual conditionings the body seems to determine the integrity of this complex 
being. The unity and the integrity are not hampered by the fact that the 
reactive dynamism and the vegetative vitality appropriate to the body happen 
within the person independently of his self-determination and without any active 
participation of the will. They occur in spite of the fact that the normal 
course of the whole vegetative vitality and somatic reactivity of man seems to 
lie beyond the reach of his consciousness. This circumstance, let us 
reemphasize, by no means contradicts man's personal unity; on the contrary, in 
its own way it is a characteristic of this unity; we thus see that there is, 
intrinsically built into the personal structure of man's unity, a structure that 
exists and is dynamized according to nature - in a different way than the way of 
the person. Obviously, the human body does not constitute a separate subject 
standing apart from the subject that is the man-person. The unity of the body 
with the ontic subjectivity of man - with the human factor - cannot be doubted. 
The experience of oneself as the subjective ego, the experience of one's own 
subjectivity, is, however, related to the reflexive function of consciousness, 
which tends to include only the specific aspects of the body and its mobility; 
this seems to be sufficient for man to have experience of his own subj 
ectivity.</P>
<P align=justify>We already noted that to have this experience man needs to be 
aware neither of the internal reactions of his organism nor of his whole, 
vegetative vitality. Neither does he need to be the active agent, the actor. (We 
know that the ascetic practices of the Yogis have as their aim the conscious 
control also of the internal reactions of the organism, but to control is not 
the same thing as to engender, which is always a matter of the efficacy of the 
body itself.)</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Synthesis of Action and Motion</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>From the preceding remarks we can see that within the frame of 
the integral subjectivity of the person - the subjectivity that is also 
reflected in consciousness - the body seems to have a somewhat separate 
"subjectivity" of its own - without, however, affecting in any way the ontic 
unity of man. Its subjectivity thus exists only in the sense that the body as 
such is the subject solely of reactions; hence its subjectivity is reactive, 
vegetative, and external to consciousness. The integrity of the man-person 
consists therefore in the normal, indeed, in the possibly perfect matching of 
"somatic subjectivity" with the efficacious and transcendent subjectivity of the 
person. Such integrity is <I>the </I>condition of the person's integrity in the 
action. Any defects in this respect are a threat to man's unity and may lead to 
his disintegration; that which is like the body's own subjectivity, the reactive 
and vegetative subjectivity of the body, is then out of tune with the person as 
the efficacious subject. We may say that it breaks out from the control of the 
person and gains a disadvantageous "independence." We then observe a kind of 
abnormality, something that seems contrary to nature; for it appears natural for 
the reactive and vegetative subjectivity of the body to be in tune with the 
person, the efficacious subject who is conscious of himself - at least in the 
sense in whicb such harmony corresponds to the human nature of the person.</P>
<P align=justify>To speak meaningfully of the body as if it were on its own is 
possible only because of the specific autonomy with respect to the person's 
self-determination - its conscious efficacy - of the somatic dynamism and the 
related vegetative vitality of man. It is against the background of this 
specific autonomy, which can be seen as the instinctive spontaneity of the 
somatic dynamism, that we can see more clearly how the realization of every 
action, which in a visible (i.e., "external" or a purely "internal") manner 
incorporates this spontaneous bodily dynamism, rests on a specific integration. 
Integration of the person in the action presupposes the integrity of the body. 
We may say that at the moment of self-determination man puts into operation the 
reactive dynamism of the body and in this way makes use of it, or, putting it 
differently, that at the moment of self-determination he consciously uses it by 
taking part in its operation.</P>
<P align=justify>This becomes apparent when we observe the dynamic synthesis of 
an action with a motion. Since external actions, that is, actions concretely and 
visibly manifested by the motions of the body, are very numerous, the synthesis 
is of frequent, indeed commonplace occurrence. A bodily motion is in itself 
something somatic and strictly related to the reactive potentiality of the body, 
to its ability to react to stimuli. This ability reaches deep into the inner 
system of the human body and is displayed as a distinctive power or skill, the 
<I>vis motrix </I>or motor power. Coming as a reaction to some definite stimulus 
a motion may be wholly spontaneous, instinctive, and is then called an 
"impulse." The occurrence of impulses in man seems to be an external indication 
of a certain measure of independence of the body from the will as well as of its 
potential ability and dynamic specificity. In a normal individual the synthesis 
of the action and motion takes place ceaselessly; while impulses may be viewed 
as activations of the body alone that lack the moment of personal efficacy, this 
moment is always present in the synthesis of the action with motion. In such a 
synthesis a given motion being dictated by the will may itself constitute the 
action or it may form part of an action that consists of a broader dynamic whole 
(for instance, the action of going to school includes many motions, in 
particular those of walking). The human body, as already noted, is for the 
person the territory and the means of his expression.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Moment of Skill in the Action-Motion Synthesis</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The element of skill or proficiency is a very important trait 
in the dynamic action-motion synthesis. The term "skill," as the equivalent of 
the Latin <I>habitus, </I>seems highly adequate here inasmuch as <I>habitus 
</I>denotes both a skill and a virtue; of these the latter refers to the 
<I>habitus </I>of spiritual life and the former, conformably with everyday use, 
to the body. Man may have a skilled or unskilled body and this is always 
reflected in his motions. The mobility of the body is innate in man and strictly 
connected with his somatic reactivity, which in turn may be converted in the 
appropriate nerve centers into definite motor impulses. The conversion itself is 
also instinctive and spontaneous. Bodily motions are the territory in which man 
develops his first skills, the earliest motor habits being formed in connection 
with instinctive reactions and impulses. At an early stage of motor development 
this process begins to be influenced by the will, which is the source of motor 
impulses coming from the interior of the person, of impulses that bear the mark 
of self-determination. When this happens we have that synthesis of the action 
with motion which functions as the frame wherein various skills continue to 
develop.</P>
<P align=justify>The presence of skill makes the whole motor dynamism, the whole 
of human mobility so spontaneous and fluent that in most cases we never notice 
the causative effect of the will in the synthesis of actions and motions. Our 
awareness is aroused only in the rare instances of motions that are 
exceptionally difficult or important and significant, for example, in mountain 
climbing, during a surgical operation, or for quite other reasons while 
performing liturgical functions. In such special circumstances nearly all our 
attention concentrates on making the necessary motions, and then we have a more 
or less clear experience of conscious efficacy. In ordinary and customary 
motions the element of proficiency or skill reduces the role of attention and 
thus weakens the experience of conscious efficacy. Habitual motions are made as 
if the will did not enter into play. It is a different question whether they can 
be treated as mere impulses, whether the efficacious engagement of the will 
played its part in developing the necessary habit or motor skill.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Somatic Constitution and Human Mobility</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>There is still another point worth noting in connection with 
the question of motions and the mobility of man, namely, that in every 
individual case his mobility constitutes a specific, in a way phenomenological 
whole with the structure of the body, that is, with his entire constitution. 
This dynamic whole manifests itself outwardly but its origin has to be sought 
within the human body, in its reactivity, with the specific ability of the 
individual to transform stimulations into motor impulses. Mobility as the 
manifestation of the somatic reactivity, which is partly innate and partly 
acquired through early developed skills, corresponds to and derives from the 
specific traits of the organism. This presumption seems to have lain and still 
to lie at the origin of all the attempts to classify people according to their 
temperaments, though of course besides the somatic elements these 
classifications also account for the psychical aspects. Indeed, the definitions 
of the various temperaments are primarily concerned with the psychical rather 
than the somatic dispositions of man, albeit they also clearly attempt to 
establish a relation between the one and the other.</P>
<P align=justify>Finally, as a conclusion to these remarks on the dynamic 
action-motion synthesis, we should note that in this domain we sometimes observe 
various forms of disintegration that may be defined as purely somatic. Such 
disintegration may take the form of the absence of a certain organ or member of 
the human body resulting in the disability to make certain motions, or it may be 
due to an absence of some, purely somatic reactions or skills leading to 
impediments or disorders of human acting. These defects are to some extent 
outwardly observable, but their source always lies inside the human body. It is 
perhaps necessary to stress that the purely somatic obstacles as such have but a 
physical and in nowise a moral significance. A man who has lost an arm or has 
had a lung removed is subject to very definite limitations or difficulties in 
his acting, but these are external in the sense that they do not in themselves 
distort his consciousness or prevent his self-determination. On the contrary, 
very often a human being with a high degree of somatic disintegration may 
represent a personality of great value.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>8. <B>INSTINCT AND THE PERSON'S INTEGRATION IN THE ACTION</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Complex Nature of Instinct</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Before we end our discussion of the person's integration in the 
action viewed from the somatic and reactive point of view, we have still to 
consider the question of instincts. The term "instinct" in the current usage 
stresses the drive aspect of impulse; it is in this sense that the term has been 
used in this study. Indeed, while we may perhaps speak of "instinctive 
reactivity" with reference to the human body or "instinctive movements" 
(reflexes), it would be difficult to associate them with the drive aspect or the 
urge inherent in instincts. Hence instinctive reactions are indicative of a 
dynamization that is appropriate to nature itself, while instinct with its 
inherent drive tells of nature's dynamic orientation in a definite direction. 
This is what we mean when speaking of the instinct of, or urge for, 
self-preservation and of the sexual or reproductive instinct or drive. So 
conceived "instinct" does not refer to any particular reaction as a purposeful 
activation of the somatic subject, which is what we have in mind when in 
everyday speech we call such a reaction "instinctive": the term seems to refer 
to the resultant of several instinctive reactions of the body and thus to a 
trait of nature itself in its dynamic and clearly defined directing towards an 
end; obviously we are now speaking not of nature in the abstract but as a 
concrete existing reality, that reality existing in the person which we tried to 
describe earlier in this study. It is from the standpoint of this reality that 
man is equipped with his proper instincts.</P>
<P align=justify>Instinct with its inherent drive is a form of man's dynamism on 
account of nature and, so far as man forms part of nature, so far as he remains 
in intimate union with nature; but at the same time instinct does not consist 
solely of the somatic dynamism in man. This is why its interpretation in somatic 
terms alone can never be complete. In fact, instinct as a definite dynamic trait 
affects also the human psyche, and it is in the psyche that it finds its proper 
expression. This is certainly true in the case of the instinct of 
self-preservation and perhaps even more vividly in that of the sexual drive. The 
psychical aspect of instinct is expressed in the specifically emotive urge that 
assumes the specific type of orientation of the particular instinct and even to 
some extent generates this orientation. The experience itself of this urge, of 
an incitement or an objectively felt necessity, has a psycho-emotive character 
while the reaction of the organism only supplies it with the somatic ground. 
Since we are at present concentrating upon the somatic side of man and its share 
in the person's integration in the action our concern is mainly with the somatic 
aspect of human instincts, but we must remain aware that they are not simply and 
solely a somatic dynamism.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of Instincts to Somatic Reactivity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The basic conditionings of instincts are, nevertheless, to be 
looked for in the human body, in the body's specific reactivity. So far as the 
instinct of self-preservation is concerned it constitutes something akin to a 
resultant; it is also the common element of several vegetative reactions; for 
the instinctual end of these reactions is to preserve vegetative life and to 
maintain its proper development. The maintenance and development of vegetation 
entail the need for its preservation, hence also the need for self-protection 
and self-defense against anything that could impair or destroy it. The human 
organism is equipped with the necessary mechanisms of self-protection which 
functions automatically, that is to say, according to the rules of nature 
without engaging conscious awareness or the person's efficacy. In this respect 
the human body's own efficacy is self-sufficient; its contact with consciousness 
is maintained by means of the so-called "bodily sensations." In such common 
statements as "I'm fine" or "I'm sick" we refer precisely to these sensations. 
Such assertions may often inform us also about man's spiritual condition though 
usually they serve to describe his physical state. Sensations of health or 
illness, of strength or weakness have a self-protecting significance: through 
them not only the body but also the instinct of self-preservation, which is 
strictly connected with the body's vegetative vitality, manifests itself. The 
elementary sensation of hunger and thirst - as well as their satisfaction - 
springs from the instinct of self-preservation; in addition, the enormous 
progress in medical science and art may be related to this instinct. Clearly the 
instinct is not restricted to the somatic but constitutes a dynamic trait of the 
human being and existence as a whole.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Instinct of Self-Preservation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The full significance of this dynamic trait is metaphysical and 
so the understanding of instinct must also account for it. At the origin of the 
instinct of self-preservation there is indeed a principle and a fundamental 
value: <I>existence itself </I>constitutes this principle, and this value, for 
the instinct of self-preservation expresses the compulsion to exist, that 
"subjective necessity" to exist which pervades the whole dynamic structure of 
man. All the somatic dynamisms preserving the vegetation of the individual are 
subservient to this compulsion as well as to the emotive urge felt whenever the 
vegetation and with it the whole physical existence of man (his material 
existence) is threatened. This feeling meets the intellectual affirmation of 
existence, the awareness that "it is good to exist and to live" while it would 
be "bad to lose one's existence and one's life"; the fundamental value of 
existence is reflected in this intellectual affirmation. Hence the instinct of 
self-preservation becomes a consciously adopted attitude, a primary concern of 
man and a fundamental value. In his mind, man, as we well know, may reject the 
value of his own existence and substitute negation in the place of affirmation, 
which shows that the instinct of self-preservation has no absolute control over 
the person. However, even in this respect the question emerges whether the 
intent of those who commit suicide is not to exist <I>at all </I>or perhaps only 
cease to exist in a way that seems to them unbearable.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Instinct of Sex and Reproduction</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Even a brief analysis of the instinct of self-preservation 
shows how difficult it would be to reduce it in man to its somatic aspects 
alone, how powerfully it is reflected in the psyche, and how great is the share 
of consciousness in the shaping of the processes that it generates. The same 
applies, perhaps even in a greater degree, to the sexual drive. The drive of 
sex, which relies on the momentous division of mankind into male and female 
individuals, stems from the somatic ground and also penetrates deeply into the 
psyche and its emotivity, thereby affecting even man's spiritual life. While the 
desire to maintain the existence of one's own being derives from the instinct of 
self-preservation, likewise the desire for sharing with another human being, the 
desire that springs both from close similarity and from the difference due to 
the separation of the sexes is based on the instinct of sex. The sexual drive in 
its integral dynamism and purposefulness becomes the source of the propagation 
of life; hence it is simultaneously the instinct of reproduction, to which man 
owes the preservation of his species in nature. This natural desire is the basis 
of marriage and through marital life becomes the foundation of the family.</P>
<P align=justify>The reproductive, procreative trait is most clearly manifested 
at the somatic level of the instinctual dynamism, the dynamism manifesting 
itself in strictly defined reactions of the body that to some extent 
automatically or spontaneously <I>happen </I>in man. In spite of all their 
specificity and automatism, however, these reactions remain sufficiently 
conscious to be controllable by man. Essentially, this control consists in the 
adaptation of the body's instinctual dynamism of sex to its proper end. Though 
possible, the control of the sexual drive may, and often does raise many 
difficult problems, especially for individuals whose sexual desire is unusually 
strong; this does not consist in somatic reactions alone but also in a special 
psychical urge of the emotive type. The point of view of ethics on the need for 
controlling the sexual drive was discussed more fully by the author in another 
book, the theme of which is human love and the ensuing responsibilities,<SUP>65 
</SUP>where also the purely somatic structures, whereby the instinct of sex 
manifests itself, are considered. The structures, whose roots reach deep into 
the human organism, determine the significant somatic differences between men 
and women.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Correct Interpretation of Instincts</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>These considerations suggest that the problem of instincts, 
here limited to two examples, is not a purely somatic one, even though both the 
instincts of self-preservation and of sex are rooted deep within the human body 
and its natural reactivity. Does the significance of instincts in the person 
derive first of all from the subjective force of those somatic reactions as such 
which are liberated because of instincts, or is it rather the outcome of the 
objective value of the ends, to which man is urged and directed by instincts? It 
is a separate problem, which cannot be discussed here. It suffices to say that 
in view of the rational nature of the human person it seems more plausible to 
accept the latter alternative. Since in this chapter we have been dealing with 
the relation of the somatic to the integration of the person in the action the 
problem of instinct is considered mainly from the point of view of the 
subjective reactivity of the body, in which both the instinct of 
self-preservation and that of sex are very clearly apparent. In this approach 
the integration of instincts in the actions of the person is but an element of 
the more general problem, which is presented by the integration of the natural 
dynamism of the body in the action. We have seen, however, that this one 
particular element does not provide the full solution to the question of the 
integration of instincts, a question requiring a broader look at the 
psycho-emotive element.</P></FONT>
