<P align=center>CHAPTER SIX</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>PERSONAL INTEGRATION AND THE PSYCHE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>I. THE PSYCHE AND THE SOMA</P></b>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Fundamentals of the Psychical Component</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>At the beginning of the preceding chapter we presented an 
interpretation of the fundamental significance of integration, which in the 
analysis of the personal dynamism of man plays the complementary aspect to 
transcendence. The person's transcendence in the action manifests itself and is 
brought into prominence by self-determination and efficacy. Both of them are in 
turn the distinguishing trait and the consequence of the structure of 
self-possession and self-governance. Considering the characteristic complexity 
of the structure, we have been trying to bring into relief its second feature by 
introducing the notion of the "person's integration in the action." This feature 
is indispensable inasmuch as every human action is due not only to the 
transcendence of the person acquired in self-determination and efficacy but also 
to the control exercised over the dynamic subjective ego by self-determination 
and efficacy. We understand here the dynamism of both the human soma and the 
human psyche. They may happen to be activated automatically; however, in action 
they surrender to the direction and control of the will. The person's 
integration in the action depends on this surrender to the will, and thus by 
complementing transcendence it plays its own role in shaping the structure of 
self-possession and self-governance.</P>
<P align=justify>When approached along these lines the analysis of human action 
allows and even compels us to investigate the psychosomatic dynamism of man. We 
saw in the preceding chapter that this dynamism constituted a specific kind of 
unity, a complex manifold unity. The psyche and the soma are distinctive with 
respect to each other even though they form a mutually conditioned unity in man. 
It is the notion of integration that provides the key to the interpretation and 
the understanding of their unity, and our aim in the preceding chapter was to 
demonstrate this with regard to the soma; for man's complexity in this respect 
allows us to isolate to some extent the somatic element from the psychical and 
to define more precisely their respective dynamisms. They appear to have a 
crucial significance in revealing what integration actually is. For this reason 
we tried to demonstrate, in the preceding chapter, how reactivity, a 
characteristic trait of the human soma related to the external mobility of the 
body, is constituted from the specific raw material of the action. Our aim at 
present is to undertake a similar analysis with regard to the psyche. It is only 
natural that though our analysis relates to the research of particular sciences, 
which with their own methods study the body and the psyche of man, we proceed by 
our own method and approach. We restrict our present analysis, as already noted, 
to the general description of the relevant dynamism.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Meaning of the Term "Psyche"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It seems necessary, however, to stop for a moment in order to 
consider first the notion of the "psyche," which is to be distinguished from the 
notion of the "soul." In every day use we contrast the notion of the "soul" with 
that of the "body." But in this juxtaposition the correct significance of these 
notions is metaphysical and requires a metaphysical analysis of human reality. 
Since this study tends to keep within the limits of metaphysical analysis we 
shall return to the notion of the "soul" at the end of this chapter. Even though 
the Greek term "psyche" means the soul, the two terms are not synonymous. 
"Psyche" refers to that which makes man an integral being, indeed, to that which 
determines the integrity of his components without itself being of a bodily or 
somatic nature. And yet, precisely for this reason, the notion of the "psyche" 
is correlated with the notion of the "soma."</P>
<P align=justify>Approached in its distinctive features, the concept of the 
"psyche" and the adjective "psychical" apply to those elements of the concrete 
human being that in the experience of man we discern as in a way cohesive or 
integrated with the body but that in themselves diffet from it. Subsequent 
analyses will help us in defining more precisely these elements as well as their 
relation to the somatic. Our above differentiation indicates the experientially 
intuitive basis of our conception of the "psyche" and the adjective "psychical." 
It draws upon intuitive insights close to a phenomenological approach in which 
we may distinguish clearly, on the one hand, their separateness from what is 
usually called "somatic" and, on the other, their specific unity with it. The 
disclosure of what is distinctively psychical but simultaneously related to what 
is somatic in man provides the groundwork for conclusions to be drawn first, 
about the relation between soul and body and second, on a still more distant 
plane between spirit and matter. For the moment, we will consider in some detail 
man's psyche from the point of view of the integration of the person in the 
action; for the modalities of integration are the key to grasping and 
understanding the human psyche, just as the psyche itself was the key to 
grasping and understanding the human soma.</P>
<P align=justify>It has been already pointed out that integration presupposes a 
certain integrity of the somatic and makes use of it. The presentation of this 
fact was perhaps the most adequate in the analysis of the relation existing 
between action and motion: it is in this relation that the integrating will not 
only generates the motion but also utilizes the resources of the natural somatic 
dynamism, the natural reactivity and mobility of the body. Thus the integration 
of the body is a notion that includes not only the, so to speak, static total of 
the mutually coordinated limbs and organs but also the ability to react 
correctly, "normally," and, insofar as it is necessary, efficiently. All this is 
contained in the notion of somatic integration. As is to be seen this 
integration manifests that most obviously exteriorized element of the bodily 
constitution which we are inclined to associate with the whole statics and 
dynamics of the human body.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Man's Psychical Functioning and His Somatic 
Constitution</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Man's entire psychical functioning is the basis of the 
integration of the person in the action; it does not, however, exteriorize 
itself in the same way as does somatic functioning. There is no such thing as 
the "psychical constitution" of man, at any rate not in a sense comparable to 
his somatic constitution. In this assertion we have at once the simplest 
confirmation of the established belief that the psyche' is essentially different 
from the body. It has not the "external" attributes of the body, it is neither 
"matter" nor "material" in the sense the body is "material." Likewise the whole 
inwardness of the human body - what we call the "organism" - cannot be seen as 
interchangeable with the psyche. The functions of the psyche are "internal" and 
"immaterial" and while internally they are conditioned by the soma with its own 
proper functions, they can in no way be reduced to what is somatic. When we 
speak of the inwardness of man as of his "inner life," we have in mind not only 
his spirituality but also his psyche, the whole of his psychical functions. 
These functions as such are deprived of that external manifestation which 
together with the somatic constitution are the attributes of the body, though 
the body, as stated previously, serves in some measure indirectly to exteriorize 
them and to express them. This is why there is a justifiable tendency to deal 
with man's psychical function as a whole in its relation to the somatic 
constitution, a tendency that has for long been reflected in different 
treatments of the so-called "temperaments." It seems that the notion itself of 
"temperament" and the attempts to classify men from this point of view have had 
as their objective a more accurate definition of man's psychical integrity - 
indeed, his psychical integrity as the basis of the integration of the person in 
the action.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>2. <B>A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PSYCHE - EMOTIVITY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Etymological Interpretation of Emotivity and 
Emotion</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>What we are actually looking for, however, is a more general 
and at the same time a more fundamental characteristic of the psychical dynamism 
than a study of temperaments would entail - a characteristic that would take 
into account <I>the relation between the psychical dynamism and the soma with 
its appropriate dynamism. </I>Such a characteristic of the psychical dynamism 
also allows us to grasp man's psychical capacities, which lie at the source of 
this dynamism. In the preceding chapter we adopted an analogous approach with 
regard to the soma when we submitted that its appropriate dynamism had a 
reactive nature, by which we meant the body's ability to have reactions, which 
within the limits of the human body determine inwardly its vegetative vitality 
as well as its outwardly visible mobility.</P>
<P align=justify>Let us examine emotivity as the most significant trait of this 
dynamism as well as of man's psychic resource. The term "emotive" is usually 
associated with the rather common noun "emotion," very much like reactivity is 
associated with reaction. The association is perfectly adequate, though 
"emotion" is usually used with reference to only a certain group of 
manifestations of psychical emotivity. It seems that an "emotional experience" 
has more or less the same meaning as an "affective experience."</P>
<P align=justify>Neither the term "emotivity" nor its corresponding adjective 
"emotive" refers to feelings alone: they do not apply only to the affective side 
in man. Their meaning is broader and is connected with the whole wealth of the 
differentiated domain of human emotions, feelings, and sensations as well as 
with the related behaviors and attitudes. It would be beside the point to quote 
the different kinds of feelings and the long list of words and expressions 
denoting them, but the abundance of expressions reflecting the inexhaustible 
wealth and differentiation of all that in man is related to his feelings 
provides a cue to a better and broader understanding of emotivity. We may also 
add that the different emotions or feelings are often defined by an attributive, 
for instance, we may speak of "artistic emotions" or "moral feelings." It is 
noteworthy, moreover, that "sense" may in some uses have almost the same 
meaning, for instance, when we say, "somebody has a sense of art" or "a moral 
sense."<SUP>66</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Etymologically the words "emotive" and "emotivity" point to a 
movement or motion (from the Latin <I>movere, </I>to move) whose external origin 
is indicated by the prefix <I>ex. </I>It may be argued that in the etymology of 
the term there is nothing that cannot be asserted of the purely somatic 
dynamism, which also involves some kind of "motion," a change that originates 
from "outside." When we want to visualize the essential difference between the 
somatic and the psychical dynamisms we may find it useful to compare <I>reaction 
</I>with <I>emotion </I>and <I>reactivity </I>with <I>emotivity. </I>While the 
somatic impulse taking place in the case of reaction and reactivity in no way 
exceeds the capacity of the body, in the case of emotion and emotivity that 
capacity is definitely transcended both in quality and essence. This seems to be 
indicated by the prefix <I>ex, </I>for though the psychical impulse depends to 
some extent on the body and is in various ways conditioned by the somatic, it 
does not belong to the body, and differs from it and its somatic dynamism. Thus 
even before we go into the detail of human emotivity, we have to stress the 
irreducible nature of emotions to reactions and of emotivity to reactivity. An 
emotion is not a somatic reaction but a psychical event that is distinctive in 
its nature and qualitatively different from the reaction itself of the 
body.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Emotivity and Reactivity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have so far pointed out the intrinsic relation between the 
somatic and the psychical aspects in man. The psychical is conditioned by the 
somatic. Emotivity, which appears to be the characteristic trait of man's 
psychical dynamism, is conditioned by reactivity, which is a characteristic of 
his somatic dynamism. It seems that at this point we come across an important 
trail of the traditional as well as the more contemporary anthropological and 
psychological explorations. The connection between the psyche and the soma in 
their dynamic aspect is an important element in practically all discussions of 
temperaments. Moreover, since emotivity is so deeply rooted in and conditioned 
by reactivity we often speak of "psychical reactions"; not only do we frequently 
refer to such reaction but we speak of someone "reacting in such and such a 
way," by which we mean not only his somatic reaction but his comportment as a 
whole in an action that includes also his conscious response to a definite 
value. Indeed, even such a response that is a choice or a decision comprises 
some elements of somatic reactivity; man constitutes the complicated unity 
underlying that integration of the action in the person which in one way or 
another always contains in itself all the elements of the psychosomatic 
complexity. We are then perfectly justified when we say "someone reacted in such 
and such a way," though it may be that thereby we stress one aspect of this 
complex whole more than others.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Emotivity and the Conscious Response of Will</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Any adequate image of the person's integration in the action 
has to include the principle of complementarity; integration complements the 
transcendence of the person, which is realized through self-determination and 
efficacy. In this dimension human action is a conscious response through choice 
or decision to a value. But also this response has always to make use in one way 
or another of somatic and psychical dynamlsms. The integration of the person in 
the action indicates a very concrete and, each time, a unique and unrepeatable 
introduction of somatic reactivity and psychical emotivity into the unity of the 
action - into the unity with the transcendence of the person expressed by 
efficacious self-determination that is simultaneously a conscious response to 
values. But the inclusion of the conscious response to values in the human 
action takes place in a specific way, that is, through the integration of the 
whole psychoemotivity of man which is, moreover, indicative of a specific 
sensibility to values. Man's sensitivity to values based on emotive grounds has 
a spontaneous character; in this respect it manifests the same traits as 
emotivity itself, which always reflects what in the person takes place in a 
"psychical way" - similarly as reactivity reflects what in the person takes 
place in a "somatic way." Because of this spontaneous sensitivity to values the 
emotive potentiality supplies the will with, so to speak, a special kind of raw 
material; for in choice and decision an act of will is always a cognitively 
defined, intellectual response to values. Against this background we can see 
more clearly the special need of the person's integration in the action as well 
as the special significance of this integration, a significance that in some 
respects is not to be compared to somatic integration. Thus, in order to reach 
an independent interpretation of psychical integration we have to embark upon a 
comprehensive analysis of human emotivity.</P>
<P align=justify>If we establish the significance of the person's integration in 
the action from the point of view of emotivity - and this is what we aim at in 
the successive analyses in this chapter - we ought to gain a better insight into 
the person's transcendence in the action; for it is in the transcendence and not 
in the integration of the human emotivity itself that the deepest meanings of 
the spirituality of the person are manlfested, and it is there that we find the 
most adequate basis for asserting the spirituality of the human soul. The 
psychical is by contrast also emotive and sensuous.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>3. FEELINGS AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE BODY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Emotive Dynamism as a Concentrator of Experiences</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Psychology and anthropology usually discriminate between the 
corporality, the sensuousness, and the spirituality of man. Without disclaiming 
in any way the profound validity of this discrimination, indeed with direct 
reference to it, we intend to stress here the significance of emotivity, 
inasmuch as our chief objective is to draw an integrated image of human 
dynamism, insofar as it is possible. In this image emotivity defines both a 
specific form of and a specific current in a dynamism that in a special manner 
forms part of the personal dynamism of human actions. The psychical strand in 
emotivity may be seen as running between corporality and spirituality, but far 
from dividing them it interweaves with the one and the other, bringing them 
together. Apparently the function performed by the emotive dynamism consists in 
concentrating human experiences, a fact that will come out more clearly later in 
our discussion. In spite of the distinct difference between the emotive dynamism 
and the reactive dynamism of the body, they are closely interrelated and 
condition each other. All that determines and constitutes the spiritual 
transcendence of the person - his attitude toward truth, good, and beauty with 
the accompanying faculty of self-determination - stimulates a very deep emotive 
resonance in the human being. The resonance - its quality and intensity - is 
thoroughly individual and in its own way also determines the quality and 
intensity of the personal transcendence itself, or at any rate provides a 
special basis for the personal transcendence in man. Emotions are also the 
source of the expressiveness of man's actions. It follows, therefore, that an 
insight gained along these lines into the innermost recesses of specifically 
human nature can lead us very far on the way to an understanding of the person 
and the action; it would be impossible to reach a sound understanding of the 
person's integration in the action without an analysis of the 
emotivity.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Affective and the Motor Stimulus</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We may begin our analysis at the point where the somatic 
dynamism, so to speak, stops and where simultaneously emotivity comes closest to 
the reactivity of the body. Emotivity, like reactivity, is strictly connected 
with the operation of stimuli. We know that somatic reactivity consists in the 
ability to react to stimuli and in the preceding chapter we were primarily 
concerned with motor stimuli. Alongside this ability and very close to it there 
seems to be another one, namely, the <I>ability to feel. </I>This ability at the 
somatic level also consists in the reception of stimuli coming from material 
objects, from various bodies; but their effect is not somatic and does not 
consist in a reaction or a movement of the body; their effect is psychical and 
is expressed in feelings. Although conditioned by a reaction at the somatic 
level, it itself transcends through and through the somatic reaction.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Feeling Places Psychical above Somatic Subjectivity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Feeling or sensation stimuli differ essentially from the motor 
stimuli, though they very often come together (e.g., the hand is instinctively 
jerked away from a hot object). Feeling or sensation itself is not a somatic 
motion or impulse; its relation to the body is similar to that of the subject to 
an object and though in a feeling as such there is no awareness of this 
relation, the body - even one's own body - becomes ln it an objective sense 
element that also penetrates into the field of consciousness. Thus feeling and 
sensation allow man to emerge from and above what in the preceding chapter we 
called the "subjectivity of the body." While such "subjectivity" is in itself 
closely related to the somatic reactivity and to a large extent remains 
unrecorded in consciousness, the psychical subjectivity, which emerges together 
with feeling on the basis of the body, is already included in 
consciousness.<SUP>67 </SUP>For feeling as such constitutes a cognitive sensuous 
reflection of the body, which thus becomes accessible to consciousness - because 
of feeling the body becomes an objective content of consciousness and is 
reflected in it.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Feeling Underlies the Consciousness of the Body</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Since the relation of feeling and sensation to consciousness is 
of fundamental significance for personal dynamism, we must examine it here as 
carefully as possible. First, there is the feeling of one's own body; the body, 
its different states and movements are the source of sensation stimuli which 
play a decisive role in enabling man to have an experience of his body. In this 
experience feeling is included in consciousness and combines with it to form a 
single common basis of the experience, though sensuous feeling differs from 
mental awareness. Attention has been drawn on various occasions to the fact that 
the range of consciousness of the body is, so to speak, currently determined by 
the field of feeling. For instance, the whole inner dynamism of the body, of the 
organism, which is connected with the body's vegetative vitality, remains, as 
long as nothing of it penetrates into the field of feeling, beyond, as it were, 
the reach of consciousness. The clause "as it were" is important, because in 
being conscious of the body man also has a kind of general awareness of its 
inwardness and its inner dynamism. This consciousness is substantiated by means 
of the corresponding sensations and feelings, for instance, the feeling of a 
bodily pain makes the inward workings of one's own body come within the scope of 
consciousness. Such a concretization of consciousness in feeling is entirely 
sufficient as a basis for experiencing one's own body.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Feeling</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the habitual experience of one's body there are sensations 
and feelings and thus sensory stimuli expressing the body and its reactive-motor 
dynamisms. These sensations reveal to every man not a separate "subjectivity" of 
the body but the somatic structure of the whole subject that he is, of the whole 
ego. They reveal to what extent he is a body, to what extent his soma 
participates in his existence and his acting. We may even say that a bodily 
sensation - a direct reflex of the body, a reflex that in a way is being 
continually formed and shaped - has in this respect a fundamental significance 
in one's own bodily ego. This habitual experience results, as noted above, from 
many sensations or feelings and manifests itself as a general <I>self-feeling. 
</I>Physically and psychically we always feel more or less "well" or more or 
less "bad"; man always has present in him some kind of feeling or self-feeling, 
which forms a sort of psychic fabric or undercurrent of his existence of acting. 
The direct and proper object of self-feeling is the whole somatic ego, which is 
not isolated from the personal ego but is, on the contrary, intrinsically 
cohesive with it.</P>
<P align=justify>It is important to stress that man's self-feeling manifests a 
distinctly qualitative trait and value element; we all know that we may feel 
either well or unwell and that within the limits of these essential distinctions 
there are various grades and subtle differences of tone. It is this that we want 
to express when saying "I feel well" or "I do not feel well," or in many other 
similar expressions such as weary, exhausted, ill, fine, fresh, and so on. Man 
can also feel that he is efficient or inefficient in his doings and this, 
because of psychical reflection, brings into prominence the significance of 
efficiency in the motor-reactive dynamism of the body. Time and again we have 
opportunity to see how this dynamism as well as its efficiency conditions the 
so-called "higher psychical functions"; for instance, we know all too well that 
physical weariness adversely affects the mental processes of thinking and that a 
good rest "clears" the mind and brings precision to our thoughts. In this way we 
also realize how intrinsically cohesive is our somatic ego with the whole of the 
personal ego, how strict is their mutual union.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>"Precedence" of Consciousness over Feelings in Personal 
Dynamism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The feeling of one's body is a necessary condition for 
experiencing the integral subjectivity of man. In this experience the body and 
consciousness are, as it were, bound together by feeling, which is the most 
elementary manifestation of the human psyche as well as the nearest reflection 
in it of what is somatic in man. This sensory reflection in the psyche differs 
essentially from the reflexive function of consciousness, whose fundamental 
significance in having the personal experience of a concrete human ego we 
discussed at the beginning of this study. The interpenetration in this 
experience of feeling with consciousness brings into prominence the general 
relation that in the domain of human cognition exists between senses and mind. 
The relation is bilateral because a feeling we have of our own body allows us to 
establish an objective contact with it and at the same time reveals the 
psychical subjectivity integrated with the somatic body-subject. Does not a 
feeling "happen" in a psychic way within the human ego and does not this 
"happening" reveal subjectivity? Subjectivity is thus, so to speak, revealed to 
consciousness, which - with the exception of extreme cases when emotions 
overcome consciousness - retains a sort of "precedence" over feelings. In fact, 
we have the awareness (among other things) also of our feelings, which means 
that in the normal course of events they are "subordinate" to consciousness. On 
the other hand, we cannot assert the opposite, namely, that we have a "feeling 
of consciousness," that we feel our consciousness. It is this precedence of 
consciousness, which brings with it a certain order and "subordination" of 
feelings, in particular the feeling of one's own body, that is the condition of 
self-determination and thus also of self-governance and self-possession; it is 
the condition of the realization of the action, of the really personal 
dynamism.</P>
<P align=justify>The feeling of one's own body reveals the psychosomatic 
subjectivity of man. Since this occurs in relation to consciousness, which 
performs both the reflective and reflexive function, the awareness of that 
subjectivity brings with it the "subjectification" and interiorization of the 
ego in consciousness which also extends to and contains the body as <I>something 
belonging only to myself </I>and different from all other bodies. To have a 
feeling of his body allows man as much insight into his own soma as he needs for 
self-determination in the action. In the same way the person's integration in 
the action is established; the integration is equivalent to a normal experience 
of one's body, an experience that is conditioned by feeling and consciousness. 
Any defects or insufficiency of feeling that would obstruct it becomes a factor 
of disintegration.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>4. SENSITIVITY AND TRUTHFULNESS</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Consciousness of Feelings and Man's Individual 
Sensitivity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Experience of one's body is not the only instance in which 
feelings attain the status of consciousness, just as bodily sensations are not 
the only form of feeling. Man not only feels his body but he also has a more 
integral feeling of himself, he feels what determines his own ego and his 
dynamism. Moreover, he has a feeling of the world as a complex and 
differentiated set of beings, among which his own ego exists and with which it 
has different relations. The attainment by feelings and sensations of the 
conscious state shapes the experience of his own ego as being-in-the-world and 
also forms in one way or another his experience of the world. This of course 
refers primarily to the sphere that remains within the range of sense but not to 
the whole of reality, not to the universe as a whole which is encompassed by the 
human mind in its own manner. Having its own specificity and being an emotive 
occurrence, feeling is directly linked with what lies within the reach of sense; 
it is not divided from higher mental activities and their contents. Careful 
observation supplies ample evidence against any simplified compartmentalization 
in man (e.g., against any tendency to identify emotivity with sensuality). If we 
ascertain in man not only a feeling of his body or of bodies in general - to 
which he has cognitive access through sense - but also some aesthetic, 
religious, or moral feelings, then we also have evidence that the emotive 
element in him somehow corresponds to what is spiritual and not merely 
sensual.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point we touch upon some crucial problems of 
psychology, anthropology, and epistemology. The question of emotivity, and more 
directly the question of the cognitive function performed by feelings, comes 
into our considerations, however, only in general and insofar as it concerns the 
integration of the person in the action. The individual sensitivity of every 
human being is formed by the occurrence of feelings as well as by their 
intensity and their accessibility to conscious reflection.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Sensitivity and the Personal Experience of Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>When we mention sensitivity we are obviously not referring 
solely to the sensibility, to sense stimuli in the strict sense; we are not 
thinking of the acuity of vision and of hearing or of the sensibility of touch; 
we refer also to the different intentional directions of human feeling that are 
deeply rooted in man's spiritual life. But sensitivity itself does not suffice 
to reach the evidence of the transcendence of the person, of his 
self-determination and efficacy. It seems to be rather an indication only of 
what happens in the person as a subject endowed with emotive capacities and of 
what in this respect demands to be integrated. <I>Sensitivity </I>is indeed 
related to <I>sensation. </I>They have the same origin. Sensation refers in turn 
to sense-perception. Sensitivity also in a way is present in the exercise of the 
sensory faculties of man, though its character is primarily receptive rather 
than active, and this is precisely the reason why it demands integration.</P>
<P align=justify>Integration, however, is not limited only to that for which 
consciousness is responsible, that is, to the attainment by the particular 
feelings and the intentional content they carry with them of the level of 
consciousness leading to the emergence of an authentic experience of values. For 
it is to values that all feelings or sensations are intentionally directed, a 
circumstance already explained in the analysis of bodily sensations. Every 
feeling or sensation is directed to some fact within or without the subject to 
whom it belongs, but it always has that "bent for" a value, that qualitative 
trait which is so clearly marked in the feelings one has of one's own body. This 
is why a feeling or a sensation becomes in man, so to speak, the nucleus for the 
crystallization of an experience of value. Emotionalists - such as, for 
instance, M. Scheler - go so far as to maintain that feelings are the <I>only 
</I>source of man's cognitive relations to values and that apart from them there 
are no other authentic means of knowing values.~</P>
<P align=justify>We will not discuss these problems here. We may note, however, 
that experience of values based on the integration of feelings through 
consciousness is not in itself sufficient; in view of the person's transcendence 
in the action still another integration is necessary -namely, the integration 
through "truthfulness." Indeed, integration of the person in the action refers 
essentially to truth which makes possible an authentic freedom of 
self-determination. Therefore, experience of values, which is a function of 
man's sensitivity itself (and hence also a function of feelings) has within the 
dimension of the acting person to be subordinated to the reference to truth. 
<I>The fusion of sensitivity with truthfulness is the necessary condition of the 
experience of values. </I>It is only on the basis of such an experience that 
authentic choices and decisions can be formed. In this case authenticity is 
indicative of the fulfillment of freedom which depends on the certainty of 
truth, that is to say, on the reference to an authentic value and thus the 
validity of the judgment about the positive value of the object, concerning 
which a choice or a decision is being made.</P>
<P align=justify>Such an understanding of the notion of "authenticity" - based 
on truthfulness - may sometimes be contrary to its understanding based on 
sensitivity alone. The latter approach would make of sensitivity the ultimate 
criterion of values and the sole basis for experience of values; just as if 
integration in consciousness of feelings and values felt were to prevent 
integration by truthfulness as well as reflection or mental appreciation and 
judgment of values. But this is not so. Actually it is the latter integration, 
the integration by truthfulness, that has a decisive significance for the acting 
person and is also the measure of the authentic transcendence of the person in 
the action. The man who in his attitude to values would rely solely on the way 
his feelings develop is confined to the orbit of what only happens in him and 
becomes incapable of self-determination. Indeed, selfdetermination and the 
closely related self-governance often require that action be taken in the name 
of <I>bare truth </I>about good, in the name of values that are not felt. It 
even may require that action be taken against one's actual feelings.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Sensitivity as a Source of Enrichment of the Psyche</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The immediately preceding remarks do not, however, depreciate 
in any way the significance of sensitivity. This latter is itself a valuable 
endowment that greatly enriches human nature. The ability to sense, the 
spontaneous ability to feel, values is the basis for many human talents. 
Emotionalists are right when they contend that this ability in man is unique and 
irreplaceable. No intellectual approval of values leading to their objectively 
correct appreciation will ever by itself result in so expressive an experience 
as when it is guided by feeling. Neither can the intellect impart to man that 
closeness to a value and concentration on it as feeling does. Whether he remains 
blind to values when deprived of the necessary feeling, as claimed by 
emotionalists, is a matter for discussion, but there seems to be no doubt that 
he would then be incapable of having the right, the properly dynamic experience 
of them. In this sense sensitivity is indubitably an especially valuable asset 
of the human psyche, but in order to appreciate its real worth we have to take 
into account the degree to which it is pervaded by truthfulness. The same 
standards apply also to the integration of the person: the more there is 
truthfulness in his awareness of all values and in the way the actual relations 
and order among them are reflected in the experience he has of them, the more 
complete is his self-governance and mature his self-possession.</P><B>
<P align=center>5. DESIRE AND EXCITEMENT</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Concupiscent Appetite and Irascible Appetite</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In Aristotelian philosophy a very definite line is drawn 
between man's sensuousness and his rationality, but at the same time the strict 
relation between them is clearly established. This relation occurs in the field 
of cognition where the senses are meant to establish a direct contact with 
objective reality and at the same time supply, so to speak, the raw material for 
the mind; this conception is justified inasmuch as man cognizes the external 
world, the world accessible to sense, and simultaneously constitutes the objects 
of that world by means of intellectual structuration. It is why man's knowledge 
of what is "accessible" to sense is not the same as the manner in which it is 
presented by sense. Moreover, intellectual cognition extends far beyond the 
givenness received in sensory experience. The relation between sensuousness and 
rationality occurs also in the realm of what in classic thought has been 
conceived of as <I>appetite. </I>A sensory experience is the foundation of 
cognition, so the appetite of volition, sensitive appetite, supplies material or 
objectives for volition. In certain respects it may function as "rational 
appetite," though in other respects man's sensuousness is a source of specific 
difficulties for the rational exercise of his will. Let us recall that already 
in the discussion on self-determination we saw the term "appetite" covered such 
meanings as striving and concupiscence though it was broader than either of 
them.</P>
<P align=justify>Concerning the will itself, we may ask whether we can attribute 
to it a concupiscent character; certainly there seems to be no difficulty in 
this respect in the case of sense; sensuous desire is a fact well known from 
actual experience. In order to describe precisely this experiential reality St. 
Thomas discriminated between "concupiscence" or the "concupiscent appetite" and 
"irascibility" or the "irascible appetite," each representing a specific, one 
may even say a typical, version of the sensitive appetite.<SUP>69 </SUP>This 
distinction allows us to see in it, though in germinal form, an outline of a 
sort of typology. It rests on an axiological rather than psychological basis 
inasmuch as the difference between the concupiscent and the irascible appetites 
lies primarily in the differences between the types of objective, that is, their 
end, in the value accessible to sense; in the former case this is but an object 
of desire and in the latter an objective to be attained only by overcoming 
obstacles or opposition. According to Thomas Aquinas the two forms of 
conctipiscence are simultaneously the basis for the differentiation of human 
sentiments and passions. In this form we find in his writings an integrated 
interpretation of the human psyche and the psychical dynamism on the side of 
sense; we also find there, as already noted, elements for a sort of typology of 
the human individual. This typology seems even to be confirmed to some extent by 
actual observation, for we know concupiscence is a dominant trait in some people 
and irascibility in others.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Excitement as a Distinct Emotive Fact</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The discussion in this study stresses and brings to the 
forefront the emotive nature of the human psyche. The point where our approach 
meets again the traditional anthropology is the stress we put upon a definite 
experience of an emotive nature which is the experience of excitement. 
Excitement "happens" in the subject and thereby reveals his psychical 
potentiality; it is an emotive instance that differs from feeling, to which we 
have rightly attributed a certain cognitive intentionality. No such cognitive 
tendency of the psyche is present in excitement, whose character is never 
cognitive. But does it not show a desirous nature? "Desiring" consists, however, 
in pointing toward an object whereas excitement is essentially self-sufficient; 
it consists in the exercise of its process with which it is totally absorbed. 
Thus it seems that its nature is primarily and essentially emotive though its 
emotivity may show differences in quality and tone. Excitements occurring in man 
may be of an irascible or a concupiscent type. That is, <I>indirectly 
</I>excitement has an appetitive bent but what we have in view and put stress 
<I>directly </I>upon is the essential nature of the excitement as such. It does 
also entail an intentional bent "toward" or "against" something. As such, it is 
a manifestation of emotivity, a typical emotive activation of the human 
psyche.</P>
<P align=justify>Such activation is usually very distinctly set in the framework 
of somatic reactivity. Excitement is always manifested in a definite reaction of 
the body, indeed in a whole complex chain of reactions of the organism (1)lood 
circulation, breathing, a quickened heartbeat, etc.), which are very distinctly 
felt. It is a specific sensation of the body contained in the feeling of 
excitement itself; we feel and have the experience of the emotive and the 
reactive moment as one dynamic fact, and this circumstance allows us in a way to 
call the fact a "reaction." The somatic element accompanying excitement may then 
be seen as an extension to the body of a dynamism that is itself psychical. We 
have, however, to distinguish here between it and the "excitement" of the body 
as such, which itself is but a reactive fact producing but an emotive resonance. 
This near and readily felt relation to the body leads to the conclusion that 
excitement is something sensuous, a dynamic manifestation of sensuousness. It is 
usually accompanied by sensations of special intensity, by a rich sensational 
reflex, which adds to the vividness of the experience of excitement.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Difference between Excitement and Elation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Nevertheless, to reduce excitements to sensuousness alone would 
be an oversimplification. The source of excitement, the stimulus that provokes 
it, does not necessarily affect the senses. The stimulation may come from the 
experience of a value that is entirely inaccessible to sense or from 
wholehearted acceptance of ideals; then, however, we tend to speak of "elation" 
rather than of excitement. "Excitement" as such remains indicative of the sphere 
of sensuous stimuli or stimulations; elation, being spiritual in nature, may be 
accompanied in the subject by sensuous or even bodily excitement of greater or 
lesser intensity. It seems, moreover, that such excitement may to a certain 
point help the elation of the spirit but if too strong it becomes an obstacle. 
This assertion supplies additional evidence for the need for 
integration.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Excitability</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In this case integration must comprise not only the particular 
excitements but the whole of human excitability, which is the term we apply to 
this particular emotive element of the psyche. "Excitability" is the capacity 
for excitement; its direction and its tone can differ as can the excitements 
themselves. It designates also a certain sphere of human capacities that seems 
to be rather closely correlated with man's sensitivity. Though the two are 
interrelated there is also a clear-cut difference between them; excitability 
relates to other emotive facts than does sensitivity, with which, however, they 
are usually associated; for excitability itself, as well as excitement, which is 
its dynamic catalyst and nucleus, constitutes in man what may be called the 
"explosive sphere" of emotions. It seems, however, that this refers also to the 
quality of these emotions and to their subjective intensity. We thus see that 
there are reasons to distinguish between excitability and emotionality, which 
will be discussed separately. Excitability, in fact, tends to refer to an 
awakening of emotions, and because this is often rather sudden we have 
characterized it as explosive. The source of emotions is then seen as irrational 
and their experience is in itself "blind" - these are the same features that, 
apart from emotive intensity, we attribute to passions. Excitement establishes 
certain forms of human emotions and feelings, but obviously it does not exhaust 
their enormous wealth of tone and variation.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Excitability as a Constituent of Instincts</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Sensuous-emotive excitability appears to be particularly well 
rooted in the soil of human instincts. In the preceding chapter we uncovered the 
somato-reactive layer in the instincts of self-preservation and reproduction; we 
also noted that an instinct could not be reduced to the dynamism of this one 
layer alone. It also has its own appropriate psychosomatic center, which 
apparently inheres in a particular excitability, it may be the sexual 
excitability or any of the different forms of excitability associated with 
self-preservation. In either case this consists in a special capacity for 
stimuli or, in other words, the aptitude for excitement. Nevertheless, this 
aptitude is insufficient to exhaust the notion of "instinct," just as the notion 
cannot be fully accounted for by the more or less determined reactivity of the 
body, the body's definite sexual reactions, or the reactions associated with 
self-preservation. A much more convincing understanding seems to be that both 
reactivity and excitability remain at the disposal of the powerful forces of 
nature that steer them in the direction of the most elemental and fundamental 
value that is existence itself.</P>

<P align=center>6. <B>"STIRRING EMOTIONS" AND EMOTIVITY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR><I>
<P align=justify>"Stirring Emotions" Differ from Excitement</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Our analysis of human emotivity brings us now to a sphere that 
demands separate treatment, because if the reductive method were to be applied 
to it, its distinctness could easily be lost. The sphere is that of the 
experience of deep, stirring emotion, which differs from excitement. Such 
stirring emotions represent an entirely different kind of experience, a 
different subjective event, than does excitement. Although in either case we are 
dealing with essentially emotive and psychical events, the nature of a stirring 
of emotions is distinctly separate. The specific character of the experience 
involved seems best described as a deep emotional stirring, which differs from 
other emotions and feelings not only in its intensity, but in "depth," in 
"moving" and bringing to the surface man's psychic dimension otherwise remaining 
unnoticed. An emotional stirring, like excitement, "happens" in the man-subject, 
but these two psychical states are easily distinguished from each other and from 
among the various <I>passions of the soul. </I>(It is worth recalling here that 
the term "passion" derives etymologically from the Latin word for "to 
happen.")</P>
<P align=justify>Excitement, far more than deep emotion, appears as we have 
pointed out to be closely related to the sensuousness of man. While both are 
accompanied by some kind of somatic reaction, excitement is seen as more 
embedded in this reaction than even very deep emotions. We experience emotions 
as manifestations of a pure emotivity, as that activation of the psyche itself 
in which somatic under-layers are less clearly pronounced. This is the reason 
why in the experience of several types of deep emotions bodily feelings may 
appear to give priority to spiritual feelings; moreover, the content of such 
emotions is strictly related to the spiritual life of man. We may for instance 
experience an aesthetic emotion generated by the perception of something 
beautiful, a cognitive emotion that arises from the discovery of a truth, or 
various kinds of deep emotions connected with the sphere of good, in particular, 
moral good or evil. The last of these experiences, which Scheler sees as the 
deepest manifestations of man's emotivity, develops in strict relation to the 
processes of the conscience; remorse at a committed wrong is not only a judgment 
of oneself, but this experience of truth entails, as we well know from actual 
life, an unusually stirring emotional component. The same applies to the 
processes of repentance, justification, or conversion, when man's actual 
departure from evil and acceptance of good, at any rate in the initial stage of 
his acceptance, are also accompanied by deeply felt emotions. The content of all 
these emotions, and with it also their emotive tone, differs diametrically; man 
passes from the gnawing remorse of his conscience and the sometimes deep 
distress almost bordering on despair arising from his sense of guilt to a state 
of mental peace and equally deep joy, to a state of spiritual bliss.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The "Stir of Emotion" as the Core of Human 
Affectivity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have been speaking of different emotions and feelings, of 
different manifestations of man's affectivity. At their root there is always a 
<I>stirring of emotion; </I>this emotive core may be said to be</P>
<P align=justify>radiating internally and thus to produce every time a different 
emotional experience. It is this experience that we call "emotion." Each 
emotional experience is different, unique, and irreproducible, even though among 
them there are those that in respect of their emotive content are similar or 
indeed almost identical; they often differ in some detail of tone or intensity 
but their essential content is nevertheless the same. The sameness of content 
always has its experiential origin in a stirring of emotion, which is 
simultaneously colored by this content and subsequently, because of its internal 
radiation, spreads it to the whole of man's psychical sphere.</P>
<P align=justify>In this way an emotion springs forth and develops in man and 
fades away. Occasionally it may be fixed in what we may call an "affective 
state." While every emotion, a transitory one, represents an emotional state of 
the man-subject, an "affective state" is spoken of most appropriately only when 
an emotion has become fixed, though to what extent an emotion once fixed still 
remains but a stirring is another matter. What we call an "affective state," 
however, seems very often to have already departed from its original emotive 
core, which was a definite stirring of emotion, and has since been taken over by 
the will. The question of the penetration of emotions to the realm of will and 
thus also of the transition from emotional states to <I>affective attitudes 
</I>is of great significance in any discussion on the integration of the psyche, 
which is precisely the theme of this chapter.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Multifarious Richness of Emotions</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We must here return to the specific nature of emotions. We have 
just seen that it is also the specific nature itself of that emotional stirring 
or movement which spreads and infuses the psyche. When we try to characterize 
emotions and call them by different names, we in fact distinguish between <I>the 
different ways emotions are stirred. </I>For instance, different emotional 
stirrings mark the feelings of sorrow and of joy, of anger and of tenderness, of 
love and of hatred. The woTld of human emotions is rich and diversified, in many 
respects like the colors, tones, and shades on the palette of a painter. Time 
and again psychologists and to some extent also moralists have attempted to 
describe and discriminate the principal emotions, according to which the great 
wealth of man's emotional life could then be classed. It cannot be denied that 
they have had some success in their efforts, though the domain of human 
emotions, somewhat like the painter's palette, manifests an infinite spectrum of 
individual colors, tones, and shades. Moreover, emotions, like colors, can be 
mixed, they overlap and interpenetrate, they also enhance or complete and 
destroy each other. They constitute a separate and powerful realm within man, a 
separate sphere of the human subjectivity. Since emotions happen "in" man, 
subjectivity is here understood in the particular sense that has been 
distinguished earlier in this study. Their happening in man comprises their 
emergence, their growth, and their passing away. Emotional dynamism is at least 
to a large extent independent of the efficacy of the person. Already the Greek 
philosophers noticed that emotions did not depend on the mind and in their 
essence were "irrational."</P><I>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=justify>Some Criteria of Differentiation</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></I>
<P align=justify>This alleged "irrationality" of human affectivity has perhaps 
been the cause of the one-sided and oversimplified tendency to identify it with 
sensuousness. Our views on this matter were propounded earlier and here we only 
have to stress once again the specific difference between the stirring of 
emotion and excitement. On the one hand, the difference lies in their 
distinctive natures, and not just in the degree or intensity of experience. 
(Even the strongest stirring of emotion is not excitement.) The components of 
the accompanying somatic reactions of the two seem also to be different. On the 
other hand, excitement is presumably necessary to initiate an emotional 
experience when an emotional stirring alone is insufficient: but then it is not 
so much the question of the intensity itself of an emotion as of the level at 
which man's emotive capacity is operative. Apparently it is this difference of 
level that we have in mind when we speak of an "emotional stirring" as of 
something different from excitement and when we discriminate between man's 
excitability and his affectiveness. But if we can refer to different levels, it 
means that in the emotional life itself there are inherent possibilities of its 
transformation, that is, of a transition from one level to another, for 
instance, from the level of excitement to that of emotion;<SUP>70 </SUP>in this 
respect, the functioning of the human being is capable of "sublimation." 
Psychologists commonly agree to the distinction between the "lower" and the 
"higher" emotions. They also take note of the different "depth" of emotions as 
well as of their more "peripheral" or more "central" positional features. These 
distinctions presuppose an innerness of the man-person, something like an 
immaterial space, where on the ground of the role of feelings we may 
differentiate between the "central" and the "peripheral," where it is also 
possible to establish different levels of "depth" (though these levels are not 
to be confused with the levels of emotions, which, as we saw, may be either 
"lower" or "higher"). From another point of view, the different "levels of 
depth" point to a certain integration in the man-subject of his emotional 
stirrings (with the ensuing emotions) and project on the efficacy of the 
person.</P>
<P align=justify>This seems to show that the dynamism of emotions is 
specifically interrelated with the whole system of sensations and feelings, 
which penetrate to consciousness to determine in every particular case the form 
and the actual character of an emotional experience.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>7. THE EMOTIVITY OF THE SUBJECT AND THE EFFICACY OF THE 
PERSON</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Emotions Differentiate According to Their Emotive 
Content</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The preceding analyses do not exhaust the immense wealth of the 
reality that is the emotional life of man; they only give some insight and help 
to draw its characteristic outlines. Every emotion has its own emotive core in 
the form of an emotional stirring from which it radiates in its own specific 
manner; according to its proper stirring, every emotion establishes itself as an 
original and unique psychical event. If it is vested with a content - and we 
know both emotional stirrings and emotions are - then this takes place also in 
an emotive way. The content, let us stress, is neither cognitive nor appetitive 
but solely emotive. Moreover, every emotion is itself a content directly and 
simply present in man; anger, love, hatred, yearning, sorrow, or joy are all 
different contents and each can be authentically realized only as a stirring 
emotion. Each is also a manifestation and actualization of man's psychical 
capacities and each reveals in a special manner his subjectivity. It is in the 
sphere of emotions (within the confines of human emotivity) that a certain 
tension between the efficacy and the subjectivity of man is most clearly marked. 
Because of this tension the synthesis of efficacy with subjectivity as well as 
the concrete significance of the integration in this domain deserve an 
especially attentive analysis.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Spontaneity and Self-Determination</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Emotional experiences - stirring emotions or excitements and in 
their wake also the particular emotions and even passions - only happen in man 
as subject. Their happening is spontaneous, and this means they are not a 
product of personal efficacy and self-determination. We have thus to assume that 
at the root of the emotive dynamism there must be a special psychical efficacy, 
as otherwise it would be impossible to explain all that in an emotive way 
happens in the man-subject. In a sense <I>emotivity </I>itself signifies that 
spontaneous efficacy of the human psyche. When we say "it is spontaneous," we 
want to stress thereby its dynamic independence from the <I>proper efficacy 
</I>of the person, that is, from his self-determination. While experiencing 
feelings or passions man has the most vivid awareness that it is not he who is 
acting but that something is happening in him, indeed that something is 
happening <I>with him, </I>just as if he lost control of himself, as if he could 
not bring himself under control. In this connection we see that, because man as 
the person has the power of self-governance and self-possession, situations of 
deeply stirring emotions and passion present a special task for him to cope 
with.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Affectivity is not the Source of Disintegration</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The fact that with the emergence of an emotion or passion man 
is prompted to seek soille sort of integration and this becomes a special task 
for him, does not signify in any way that they are in themselves a cause of 
disintegration. The view about their disintegrating role appeared in the 
philosophy of the Stoic school and in modern times was to some extent revived by 
Kant. If the position advocating in various ways a rejection of emotions so as 
to allow man to act solely according to reason (Kant's idea of the Categorical 
Imperative) were to be maintained, then it would be necessary to accept the 
whole emotive capacity as being itself a source of disintegration in the acting 
person. The broadly conceived experience of man, with due attention paid to 
morality, prevents us, however, from accepting this view - just as it was 
rejected, for instance, by Aristotle in his anthropology and ethics or in his 
critique of the Stoics, and in Scheler's critique of Kant. The view that 
conceived of human emotivity - and in particular human emotionality - as a 
source of disintegration is a manifestation of a special sort of ethical and 
anthropological apriorism, and the essence of any apriorism is to disregard the 
evidence of experience. When we treat man's emotivity and emotionality solely as 
a source of disintegration in the acting person, we assume to some extent that 
he is <I>a priori </I>and inevitably doomed to disintegration. In this respect 
the Stoic position has to be seen as pessimistic. The pessimism in this question 
is derived, especially in Kant, from a specific sort of idealism.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Creative Role of Tensions between Emotivity and 
Efficacy</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The realism that we are trying to adhere to in our 
argumentation demands that no emotion or even passion be regarded as in itself 
the source of disintegration in the acting person. It is impossible to deny, 
however, that emotions and passions present man with special problems that he 
has to cope with. Inasmuch as self-governance and self-possession are elements 
in the structure of the person, these problems consist in the need for 
integration in human emotivity and emotionality, a need fully justified by the 
person's self-determination; for there is a clearly marked tension between the 
spontaneous efficacy of the human psyche and the efficacy of the person. The 
tension, which has manifold aspects, represents in a way the crucial moment of 
human personality and morality. In traditional anthropology it is seen primarily 
as existing between the faculties of the human soul, between the rational 
appetite (will) and the sensitive appetite. In the context of this study, 
however, we shall attempt to examine it first of all as a tension existing 
between the subjectivity and the efficacy of the person. We already know that 
the synthesis of efficacy with subjectivity in the person's action cannot be 
realized without a specific kind of effort that may be seen as the most 
appropriate effort of man's inwardness. It is this effort, this toil, that 
allowed us to compare the efficacy of the person in the action to creativity. We 
have also been to some extent prepared to deal with the problem by the analysis 
in this chapter of the relation existing between sensitivity and truthfulness in 
cognition. We can thus assert that the tension between the emotivity of the 
human subject and the personal efficacy in actions is specifically 
creative.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Emotions Tend to Be Rooted in the Subjective Ego</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The tension between self-determination, or the proper efficacy 
of the person, and emotivity, or the spontaneous efficacy of the human psyche, 
can of course be reduced to the relation between will and emotion. When this 
relation is seen as the tension between the subjectivity and the efficacy of 
man, then it is obviously with reference not to the subject as the ontic basis 
but to subjectivity as the experiential correlate of what only happens in man 
but is not his acting, in which efficacy plays a decisive role. On the other 
hand, we know emotions occur only in man. This emotive happening may be but 
transitory, like a light touch on the surface of the soul, though it also 
manifests a specific tendency to be rooted in the subjective ego. Then, if an 
emotion turns into a permanent psychical state, correlatively to it an inner 
attitude develops in man. For instance, a sudden momentary fit of anger is one 
thing, but a lasting resentment is quite another - the anger that has turned 
into an inner attitude. Likewise a short-lasting affection or hatred differs 
entirely from love or hatred that has become fixed as an inner attitude. Such 
attitudes become an intrinsic factor of human life and an especially important 
product of man's emotive capacity and dynamism. It is here that we come to the 
point where "what happens in man" is nearest to his self-determination.</P>
<P align=justify>As we know, emotional attitudes develop spontaneously. Their 
fixation and rooting in the subject arises from the same emotive dynamism that 
was at the origin of the initial emotional stirring or excitement. The fixation 
and the rooting of emotion in the subjective ego is an indication of the range 
of emotive energy and at the same time constitutes a specific accumulation of 
subjectivity and immanence. Efficacy and the related transcendence of the 
personal ego are, so to speak, drawn in and included in the subject. The 
influence of emotions on the will may be such that instead of determining man's 
attitudes, the will tends to adopt the attitude presented by emotion thus 
leading to what we call "the emotional attitude." Such attitudes are 
subjectivistic. We now see why emotion may be rightly regarded as a special 
source of subjectivism. Structurally subjectivism signifies that efficacy is 
dominated by subjectivity - to some extent it signifies the preponderance of the 
psychical immanence over personal transcendence in acting.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Role of Emotion with Respect to the Will Stresses Personal 
Efficacy</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>All these considerations do not, however, justify the 
conclusion that emotion is leading to disintegration. In spite of the 
emotionalization of consciousness, which we have already discussed, and the 
generally recognized limitations of responsibility in actions performed under 
emotional strain, there are no sufficient reasons to attribute a disintegrating 
role to emotions. Emotivity may tend to diminish the distance between the 
subjective ego and efficacy and it may to some extent thrust upon the will its 
own system of values, but by any standards it is no more than an obstacle to the 
integration of the person in the action. Indeed, integration remains possible 
and then emotion adds special vividness to efficacy and with it to the whole 
personal structure of self-governance and self-possession.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>8. <B>THE EMOTIVITY OF THE SUBJECT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF 
VALUE</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Emotivity and Conscious Efficacy</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Since in our analysis not all the elements of the relation 
between the emotivity and efficacy of man have been sufficiently attended to we 
will now examine them in some detail. We know that emotivity in man is a source 
of spontaneous subjectifications and interiorizations different from the 
subjectification and interiorization performed by consciousness. In a way the 
emotionalization of consciousness is a limiting phenomenon when excessive 
emotion damages consciousness and the ability to have a normal experience. Man 
then lives engrossed in his emotion, his excitement, or his passion, and though 
the condition is undoubtedly subjective, his "subjectivity" brings only negative 
results so far as efficacy, self-determination, and the transcendence of the 
acting person are concerned. Thus the limiting case of spontaneous 
subjectification by emotion may be said to be the</P>
<P align=justify>separation of human subjectivity from conscious efficacy. Such 
are the situations when man loses his ability to act consciously and hence also 
to be responsible, the situations when in his acting there is no real acting but 
only a special sort of happening - something happens in and with him, ;something 
that he neither determines nor fulfills. Neither can he be fully responsible for 
what is taking place, though we may well ask what is his responsibility for the 
development of the situation in which he can no longer have 
responsibilities.</P>
<P align=justify>Apart from these extreme cases, when emotivity may be said to 
have destroyed the efficacy of the person, there are still many situations in 
which efficacy is only partly limited. The degree of these limitations differs 
and depends on the intensity of the emotion involved. To speak of the "intensity 
of emotions" is a simplification that in itself appears permissible but does not 
express the whole complexity of the actual facts; if we say the degree of the 
limitation of conscious efficacy - also of responsibility - depends on the 
intensity of emotion, then we appear to be opposing emotivity to efficacy, as if 
they were but two contrary forces. The actual difference between them is, 
however, far more complex so that even the idea of psychical force cannot be 
understood in a way similar to a physical force; for the force of emotion mainly 
derives from the experience of value. Thus, it is in this domain that there are 
special opportunities and possibilities for creative integration.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Expressiveness of Human Experience is Emotional</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Asserting that the intensity of emotion "mainly derives from 
the experience of value" we touch on what appears to be the most remarkable in 
human emotivity and what distinguishes it from the purely somatic reactivity. 
Admittedly, the somatic ability to react to stimuli, in particular when they 
relate to human instincts, has from an objective point of view the traits of 
reference to values, but in this sphere there can be no actual experience of 
value; perhaps the reason is that somatic dynamisms as such are not directly 
connected with consciousness, while the link - and in its turn the experience of 
the body - is established by means of sensations. The same is not the case with 
emotions, which are intrinsically accessible to consciousness and indeed have a 
specific ability, as it were, to attract consciousness. Thus we not only become 
aware of our emotions but also our consciousness and in particular our 
experience derive from them a special vividness. The vividness of human 
experience seems to have an emotional rather than a conscious nature. We may 
even say it is to emotion in the normal course of experience - that is, apart 
from extreme or nearly extreme situations - that man owes that special "value" 
of his experiences which consists in their subjective vividness; this 
circumstance retains its significance also with regard to the cognitive aspects 
of these experiences.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Content of Emotions Refers to Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Our interest, however, is concentrated on the experience of 
value rather than on the value of experience. The present considerations have 
been prepared by earlier analyses, in particular the analysis of sensitivity. 
Both the emotional stirring and the emotions of the human being always relate to 
a value and are born out of this relation. This is true when we are angry and it 
is equally true when we love, mourn, rejoice, or hate. The reference in all 
these cases is to a value, and the whole emotion may be said to consist of this 
reference. Nevertheless, it is neither cognitive nor appetitive; the emotional 
stirring as well as emotions themselves point to values, but as such they have 
no cognition or desire of values. We may only say emotions are an indication - 
but only in the special experiential way - of values that exist apart from 
emotions, outside the subject having that emotional experience. If parallel to 
this indication or demonstration of values there is some cognition of them, then 
it results from sensations and feelings, which constitute what is like an 
"emotive condition" or "emotive reflex." The more thoroughly consciousness is 
penetrated by this reflex, the fuller and more complete becomes the experience 
of value. The emotionalization of consciousness, however, hinders this 
experience and sometimes may even prevent it. Furthermore, any emotion - also 
excitements and passions - directs its emotive content beyond itself to a 
definite value and thereby it provides an opportunity for the experience of 
value, and for the experiential cogniti6n of value.<SUP>71</P></SUP><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Source of the Spontaneous Experience of Value</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>An emotion, when stirred, spreads out and, becoming rooted in 
the subject, spontaneously sets off reference to value. The very spontaneity of 
this reference appears to be in its own way valuable; it represents a specific 
"psychical value" or something "valuable for the psyche," because the psyche on 
the basis of its own proper emotive dynamism manifests a natural inclination. 
Spontaneity - and also the spontaneous experience of value - are well suited to 
the needs of the human psyche, not so much perhaps because they would be easy to 
come by or the value would be, so to speak, given and ready-made, but because of 
the specific emotional fulfillment that is brought by such an experience. 
Emotional fulfillment is simultaneously a special kind of fulfillment of the 
subjectivity itself of the human ego; it generates a feeling of being entirely 
contained within oneself and at the same time in an intimate nearness to the 
object, that is, to the value with which the contact is spontaneously 
established.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Relieving of Tensions between Spontaneity and 
Self-Determination</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>A tension between emotivity and efficacy - mentioned previously 
-that engages two of man's forces or powers develops because of a twofold 
reference to value. Efficacy and with it also personal self-determination are 
formed through choice and decision, and these presuppose a dynamic relation to 
truth in the will itself. In this way, however, a new transcendent factor is 
introduced into the spontaneous experience of value and to the related 
experience of striving to attain the emotional fulfillment of one's own 
subjectivity. This factor directs the person toward his fulfillment in the 
action not through emotional spontaneity alone but by means of the transcendent 
relation to truth and the related obligation and responsibility. In the 
traditional approach this dynamic factor in personal life was defined as the 
intellect, a definition often reflected in everyday speech and opinions, which 
oppose emotion to reason, the latter being then' used in a broader sense than to 
denote the ability of intellectual cognition..</P>
<P align=justify>The intellect has precedence over emotion, over the emotive 
spontaneity of the human being, and denotes the power and the ability to be 
guided in choice and decision by the truth itself about good. This ability is 
decisive for that authentic spiritual power which determines the guidelines of 
human acting. The power itself, even if among its properties there is a demand 
for a certain detachment - the distance that lends truth - from spontaneously 
experienced values, is never manifested by a denial of these values, by their 
rejection in the name of some sort of "pure transcendence," a rejection that was 
apparently postulated by the Stoics and by Kant. On the contrary, the authentic 
subordination to truth as the principle controlling the choices and decisions 
made by the free human will demands an intimate interrelation between 
transcendence and integration in the domain of emotions. Indeed, we know from 
what was said before that transcendence and integration are two complementary 
aspects that explain the complexity of man's acting. Especially in what concerns 
the emotivity of the human being it seems that only such an interpretation of 
the existing complexity and not a simplifying reduction is important and may 
become relevant to theoretical and practical issues concerning the human 
being.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>9. ACTION AND EMOTION - THE INTEGRATING FUNCTION OF SKILL</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Attraction and Repulsion in the Spontaneous Reference to 
Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is at this point that we have to examine the integrating 
function of skill or proficiency. We referred to the notion of "skills" in the 
preceding chapter while examining the integration of the acting person on the 
basis of the somatic dynamism. We then saw how much every synthesis of action 
with motion owed to the skills acquired by man from earliest childhood long 
before his coming to the age of reason. Our analyses of the human psyche and 
emotivity have disclosed with sufficient clarity the tension that exists between 
the spontaneous dynamism of emotions and the efficacy of the person. Finally, we 
explained in what sense the tension between emotion ahd the intellectual 
reference to truth developed in connection with their relation to values. The 
appropriate integration in this field thus presupposes some reliance on the 
intellect and that relation to the objects of acting which is based on the truth 
about the good presented in these objects.</P>
<P align=justify>The tension between the person's efficacy and emotivity results 
from the fact that emotional dynamism introduces a spontaneous turn toward 
certain values. The turn may have an attractive or a repulsive character; in the 
former case its direction is "toward" while in the latter it is directed "away." 
While the emotive turn "toward" indicates a positive value, the repulsion, the 
turn "away," indicates a countervalue, something negative. Thus the whole 
emotive dynamism brings with it a spontaneous orientation, it introduces man 
into the profoundly antagonistic system of positivity and negativity. The fact 
that man is emotionally dynamized or oriented to the good and against the evil 
is not so much a function of any emotional stir or of emotions but reaches to 
the deeper roots of his nature. In this respect emotions follow the orientation 
of nature, which, as we already noted, is expressed by instincts. At present it 
is not a question of the instincts of reproduction or self-preservation, which 
were considered in the preceding chapter (though undoubtedly also on the ground 
of these instincts a split between attraction and repulsion occurs in the 
emotions of the relevant spheres). For the moment, however, we are interested in 
the urge, appertaining to human nature, "toward" the positive and "against" the 
negative. In this connection it is important to note that attraction and 
repulsion, of which we have spoken in only the most general terms, are not at 
first defined as to their object. To define them in this respect is the task and 
the function of the person and thus of the intellect, which cognitively forms 
man's attitude to truth, in this case the truth about "good" and 
"evil."</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Moral Decision and Spontaneous Attraction or 
Repulsion</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Different emotions introduce into man's attitude to truth their 
own spontaneous reference of an emotional and emotive character. Emotion is 
accompanied by a sense of value or countervalue. It is thus that a more or less 
distinct and vivid psychical fact is formed, a fact whose distinctness and 
vividness comprises also the intensity of the experience had consciously. For 
instance, the orientation of love~ joy, or desire is attractive and to a good, 
while that of fear, dislike, or - ln a different situation - sorrow is 
repulsive. St. Thomas rightly calls attention to another specific trait of 
emotions, which manifests itself in the element of irascibility, the most 
typical of these emotions being that of anger, an emotion essentially repulsive 
though in a special sense. In a different way this trait also appears in the 
emotional experience of courage. Earlier we noted the twofold character of human 
emotions, which are dominated either by the appetitive or the irascible element. 
The distinction according to the predominance in an emotional experience of 
attraction or repulsion seems, however, to have a special significance for the 
spontaneous orientation of the psychical subjectivity of man to the good and 
against the evil. It is this orientation, rooted deep in the urge of nature 
itself, that is the ground on which the main tension between the spontaneous 
emotivity of nature and the efficacy or self-determination of the person comes 
into play.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point we see the integrating function of proficiency. 
The significance of this function was expounded by the great masters of 
classical philosophy, and especially of ethics, in their comprehensive teaching 
on virtues or moral proficiency. Throughout this study we have stressed that 
morality intrinsically determines the humanity and the personal nature of man. 
The experience of morality is thus an integral component in the experience of 
man. Without it no adequate theory of the acting person - of the person and the 
action - would indeed be possible. The integration of the person and the action 
on the basis of emotivity (emotionality and emotivity) of the human psyche is 
accomplished through proficiency, which from the point of view of ethics 
deserves to be called "virtues." An essential element in the idea of "virtue" is 
that of moral value and this entails a reference to a norm. But even when in our 
analysis we put aside this relation pertaining to morality (at the beginning of 
this book we called the procedure "placing outside brackets") by leaving its 
examination to students of ethics, we still have facing us the purely and 
strictly personalistic problem of integration, that is, the need for finding the 
best ways for effectively relieving the tension between spontaneous emotivity 
and personal efficacy or self-determination. It is quite correct to speak in 
this connection of the "problem of integration" inasmuch as it consists in the 
realization of the personal structure of self-governance and self-possession on 
the basis of that psychical subjectivity which is spontaneously molded by the 
numerous and multifarious emotive events with their appropriate spontaneity of 
attraction and repulsion.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Function of Moral Proficiency or Virtue</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The personal structure of self-governance and self-possession 
is realized by means of different proficiencies and skills. Indeed, it lies in 
the nature of proficiencies to aim at subordinating the spontaneous emotivity of 
the subjective ego to its self-determination. They thus tend to subordinate 
subjectivity to the transcendent efficacy of the person. Their way to achieve 
this end, however, is to make the best use of emotive energy and not to suppress 
it.<SUP>72 </SUP>We may say that the will to some extent restrains the 
spontaneous explosion of emotive energy and even assimilates some of it. When 
properly assimilated this energy adds considerably to the energy of the will 
itself, and that is precisely the task of proficiency. But in the process there 
is still another purpose to be achieved gradually. The proficiencies or skills 
acquired in different domains allow the will to secure - and without any risk 
for itself to adopt as its own - the spontaneity of emotions and generally of 
emotivity. In a way spontaneity is also a trait of proficiency, though not in 
its primitive state but after transformation in the course of a steadfast 
process of character formation. So far as the reference to truth is concerned, 
the integrating process of developing and improving the psyche gradually 
produces the result that the will - guided by the light of reason - learns how 
by spontaneous reference to emotio~, by a spontaneous move of attraction or 
repulsion, to choose and to adopt the real good; it also learns how to reject 
the real bad.</P>
<P align=justify>In this sphere the integration of the acting person is a task 
that lasts until the end of a man's life. In some respects, however, it begins 
at a somewhat later phase than the somato-reactive integration, which is on the 
whole already completed when the psycho-emotive integration begins. A human 
child learns quickly the necessary movements and acquires the skills pertaining 
to this domain before he develops the particular virtues. Thus we may to a 
certain degree identify the latter of the two integrations with the task of 
character formation or molding one's psycho-moral personality. In either there 
is the moment of "bringing together," though as we noted at the beginning of the 
discussion on integration, it is not a question of bringing together in the 
literal sense - that is, to join parts to form a whole - but rather of the 
realization, and simultaneously outward manifestation, of a unity based on the 
specific complexity of the personal subject.</P><B>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>10. CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Meaning of the Terms</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>When attentively observing other people and ourselves we can 
draw a subtle distinction between what we are going to call "conduct" and 
something that in the same man we are inclined to identify as his "behavior." 
There will be no digressing from the main theme of these considerations if we 
devote some remarks to this distinction, all the more so as it brings into focus 
many questions mentioned in our analysis of the integration of the acting person 
both in the psychical and the somatic spheres.</P>
<P align=justify>The word "conduct" seems to denote the acting of the human 
being so far as it is an outcome or a resultant of his efficacy. In a sense this 
significance is metaphorical. Etymologically its meaning is associated with 
leading or guiding together or jointly, indeed, it seems to suggest a certain 
continuity of the guidance. Guidance, moreover, implies a knowledge of the road 
to be followed and thus, metaphorically speaking, it also has a certain 
normative significance: so "conduct" may be understood as "to keep to the 
marked-out course." There is nothing passive in this keeping to a course, it is 
not a result of what happens in or with man, but, on the contrary, it is 
something thoroughly active, based on efficacy and self-determination. Thus 
"conduct" points essentially to the actions that the man-person performs and 
that he fulfills himself in.</P>
<P align=justify>On the other hand, on careful examination "behavior" is found 
to contain different meanings. We use "behavior" to describe that way of acting 
or comportment of a person which is easily noticeable to an observer. Behavior 
is only connected but not identical with acting and does not refer to the same 
reality, or at least not to the same aspects of reality we have in mind when 
speaking of somebody's conduct. One's behavior, one's special way of acting that 
accompanies one's conduct, is composed of a number of elements, which are not 
necessarily, or at least not entirely, controlled by man and of which he is not, 
or at least is not the sole agent. These elements define the outward expression 
or simply the "appearance" of acting; it is through that aspect of outward 
expression or appearance that they determine how a man acts. But the "how" is to 
be referred neither to the essence itself of the action nor to the essential 
conjugation of the action and the person. The stress is on how a man behaves in 
his acting and not on how he actually acts.</P><I>
<P align=justify>Conduct and Behavior in the Person's Integration in 
Action</P></I>
<P align=justify>It is not difficult to notice how differently various people 
behave when performing similar actions; this applies to what may be said to be 
the phenomenal quality determined by somato-constitutive as well as 
psycho-emotive factors. These factors give an action performed by someone tall 
and of spare frame a different "appearance" than a similar action by someone 
square-built and stocky. Similarly, the speech, the gesture, and the pose of a 
spirited and vivacious speaker sound and look different from those of one who is 
slow and phlegmatic. Even when they do the same thing each does it somewhat 
differently, and this precisely means that he <I>behaves </I>differently.</P>
<P align=justify>The difference between conduct and behavior may throw some 
additional light on the problem of the integration of the person in the action, 
the problem that we have been investigating in this and the preceding 
chapter.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>11. <B>THE PERSON'S INTEGRATION IN ACTION AND THE SOUL-BODY 
RELATION</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Human Complexity Revealed in Transcendence and 
Integration</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>So far "integration" has been understood as the manifestation, 
and simultaneously the realization, of unity on the basis of the multifarious 
complexity of man. In this sense integration is a complementary aspect of the 
dynamism of the person, an aspect that, as we saw, is complementary to 
transcendence. It is on this assumption that we have considered primarily the 
question how the unity of different dynamisms is manifested in the actions of 
the person. This unity itself is differentiated and diversified, which was also 
shown, if only indirectly, in the attempts to characterize the dynamisms of the 
soma and the psyche of man. So far, however, we have not investigated thoroughly 
the problem of the complexity of man. We may even assume that the dynamic 
approach to the acting person leads us to seek his unity rather than to dwell 
upon his complexity.<SUP>73</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>To conclude these considerations let us emphasize that man's 
complexity appears to be most clearly revealed by the reality of integration. 
Integration not only brings into view the unity of various dynamisms in the 
action of the person but also discloses the structures and layers of the 
complexity of the human being. The different layers of the psychosomatic 
complexity were mentioned on various occasions in the course of the analysis of 
integration, but obviously to show the psychosomatic complexity in man is by no 
means equivalent to disclosing also the proper relation of soul to body and 
inversely.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of Soul and Body to Integration and 
Transcendence</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>An insight into the relation between the soul and the body may 
be reached only through the total experience of man. The notion of the 
"integration," as of the "transcendence," of the "person in the action" serves 
to circumscribe - in various perspectives - the content of this experience. When 
speaking of the "integration of the acting person" we are scanning the complete 
territory of human experience in search of not merely a description but a 
thorough and deep understanding of it in the phenomenological sense, inasmuch as 
the sum total of the data from this experience is comprised by the notion of 
"integration," just as, from a different point of view, it is comprised by the 
notion of "transcendence." We have tried to show this in our previous analyses. 
We find a great wealth of various types of dynamisms at both the somatic and the 
psychical levels; and it is due to integration that these dynamisms become 
"personal" and related as well as subordinated to the transcendence of the 
person in the action. They thus find their place in the integral structure of 
the self-governance and self-possession of the person. Our analysis of the 
integration of the acting person on both the psychical and the somatic levels 
has, as we have already stated, revealed the complexity in man. We cannot 
pretend, however, that to assert the complexity is equivalent to an insight into 
the soul-body relation of the human being. Experience of transcendence and 
integration presumably c6r-responds approximately to what was often referred to 
as the "higher" and the "lower" man, an expression stressing the difference 
derived from the experience of man and his self-consciousness.<SUP>74</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Here we have to recall our earlier remarks about the 
"experience of the soul." We have, in fact, submitted that man had no direct 
experience of his soul. Experience of the transcendence of the person in the 
action together with all the elements and aspects of this experience is in no 
way equivalent to a direct experience of the soul. Similarly, we have to assert 
that experience of integration (in connection with the transcendence of the 
person in the action) cannot be identified with the experience - the direct 
discovering and experiencing - of the soul-body relation. Both the reality 
itself of the soul and that of the soul's relation to the body are in this sense 
transphenomenal and extraexperiential. Nevertheless, the total and comprehensive 
experience of man shows the soul as real and as staying in relation to the body. 
They have been both discovered and are continuously being discovered in the 
philosophical reflection resulting from human experience.</P>
<P align=justify>We may add that the soul-body relation is also intuitively 
given - in an implicit way - in the experience of man as a real being. In this 
respect the subordination of the system of integration of the human person to 
the transcendence of the person in the action is revelatory.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Current and Hylomorphic Meaning of the Soul-Body 
Relation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Intuition indeed appears to pave the way for, and lead us near 
to, an understanding of the soul-body relation, but as we have mentioned, it 
does not allow us to grasp this relation. We may approach it solely in terms of 
metaphysical categories. All the more so as the full meaning of this relation 
appears as a philosophical issue once the notions of soul and body receive a 
metaphysical interpretation. However they also have a current sense. This 
current sense of the "soul" and its relation to the "body" is a fruit of 
commonsense experience. It is this relation to experience in which is firmly 
grounded the essentially metaphysical significance of the notions of "soul" and 
"body," and only in which they acquire their complete meaning for metaphysics. 
For us the important things are thus, first, that on the evidence of experience 
and intuition we may exfoliate the complexity of man, and second, that we are 
able to define its limits.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Soul as the Principle of Transcendence and 
Integration</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>An understanding of the soul-body relation is obviously 
promoted by a knowledge of the character of somatic and psychosomatic dynamisms 
and also of certain limits thereby disclosed within the total dynamic system of 
the man-person. It then becomes manifest that the total and also adequate 
dynamism of the person - resulting in action - transcends them. None of those 
other particularized dynamisms are identical with the action, though every one 
of them is in different ways contained in it. While the somatic dynamism and 
indirectly the psycho-emotive dynamism have their source in the body-matter, 
this source is neither sufficient nor adequate for the action in its essential 
feature of transcendence. This was one of the final conclusions in the analysis 
of the transcendence of the person in the action, where the relation between the 
transcendence and the spirituality of man was stressed.</P>
<P align=justify>Now, before we close the analysis of the person's integration 
in the action, it is necessary to go still farther in our conclusions. While the 
body itself is the source of the reactive dynamism, specific for the human soma, 
and indirectly also for the emotive dynamism of the human psyche, the 
integration of these two dynamisms has to have a common origin with the person's 
transcendence. Can we infer that it is the soul that is the ultimate source or, 
to put it differently, the transcending principle and also the principle of the 
integration of the person in the action? At any rate, it seems that this line of 
reasoning has brought us much closer to approaching the soul.</P>
<P align=justify>Our analyses indicate something like a boundary in man, which 
sets a limit to the scope of the dynamism and thus also of the reach of the 
body, or of what is also called "matter." They also reveal a capacity of a 
spiritual nature that seems to lie at the root of the person's transcendence, 
but also indirectly of the integration of the person in the action. It would, 
however, be a gross simplification if we were to regard this intuitively drawn 
limit of the body (matter) capacity as equivalent to the boundary <I>between 
</I>the body and the soul. Indeed, the experience of integration intervenes with 
such an oversimplification. Integration - precisely because it is the 
complementary aspect of the transcendence of the person in the action - tells us 
that the soul-body relation cuts across all the boundaries we find in experience 
and that it goes deeper and is more fundamental than they are. We thus have 
confirmed, even if indirectly, our earlier assertion that the complete reality 
of the soul itself and of the soul's relation to the body needs a more 
comprehensive metaphysical expression.</P></FONT>
