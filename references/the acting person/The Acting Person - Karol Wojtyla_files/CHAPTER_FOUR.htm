<P align=center>SELF-DETERMINATION AND FULFILLMENT</P></b>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<DIR>
<P align=center>1. <B>PERFORMING AN ACTION BRINGS PERSONAL FULFILLMENT</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></DIR><I>
<P align=justify>The Crucial Significance of Fulfillment in an 
Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>When we assert that the performance of an action brings 
fulfillment and then look at the content of this assertion, we can glimpse the 
wealth of meanings it carries and also notice the bearing it has on our previous 
discussion of the person's transcendence in the doing of an action. It is this 
fulfillment in performing an action, the performer's fulfillment of himself, 
that we must now consider.</P>
<P align=justify>All the essential problems considered in this study seem to be 
focused and condensed in the simple assertion of fulfillment in an action. 
Indeed, we are here concerned with the person and the action not as two separate 
and self-sufficient entities but - and we have emphasized this from the start - 
as a single, deeply cohesive reality. Insofar as this cohesion has real 
existence, it must be reflected in comprehension or interpretation. If so, then 
undoubtedly the existential and essential cohesion of the person and the action 
is best and most adequately expressed by the fulfillment resulting from 
performance of an action. This is the reason why it is necessary to include this 
fact in the philosophical interpretation of the acting person. We shall consider 
it here as a continuation of our earlier analysis of the personal structure of 
self-determination, and supplement it with an analysis of this structure from 
the point of view of the fulfillment that in the action corresponds to 
self-determination, which we already know to be deeply rooted in the dynamic 
structure of the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Inner and Intransitive Effects of an Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The fact that every performance of an action means fulfillment 
makes "to fulfill" almost synonymous with "to perform." This is why fulfillment 
seems to be the best homologue of the term "act," indicating the fullness which 
corresponds to a definite possibility or potentiality. In our approach we are 
looking for what could be an adequate manner of expressing the person as the 
subject and the agent of an action and at the same time of expressing an action 
as the authentic act of a person. When we speak of "performing an action" we see 
the person as the subject and the agent while the action itself appears as a 
consequence of the efficacy of the agent. This consequence is external with 
regard to the person, but it is also internal to, or immanent in, the person. 
Moreover, it is both transitive and intransitive with regard to the 
person.<SUP>51 </SUP>In either case it is most strictly connected with the will, 
which we already saw in the preceding chapter to consist in both 
self-determination and intentionality. Self-determination is something more 
basic for the will, and it is to it that the fundamental significance of freedom 
is related. Intentionality, on the other hand, is in a way secondary to and 
integrated by self-determination. It is this intentionality that reveals the 
expanded significance of freedom.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Fulfillment in Action Is Presupposed in 
Morality</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It seems necessary to stress at this stage in our discussion 
that we are here primarily, if not exclusively, concerned with action as the 
<I>inner and intransitive consequence of a person's efficacy. </I>In taking this 
standpoint we intend to analyze the whole dynamism of the fulfillment which 
comes from performing an action, beginning with the personal structure of 
self-determination. What was said previously about the dynamism of the will 
explains why actions which are the effect of the person's efficacy, namely those 
actions "proceeding" from actual existing, have simultaneously the traits of 
outerness and innerness, of transitiveness and intransitiveness; for every 
action contains within itself an intentional orientation; each action is 
directed toward definite objects or sets of objects, and is aimed outward and 
beyond itself. On the other hand, because of self-determination, an action 
reaches and penetrates into the subject, into the ego, which is its primary and 
principal object. Parallel with this there comes the transitiveness and 
intransitiveness of the human action.</P>
<P align=justify>Every action has in some respects the existential status of a 
transitory reality, which has a beginning and an end in either of its 
dimensions, the external and the internal. The latter of these dimensions is of 
special interest for us inasmuch as we are primarily concerned with the relation 
itself between the action and the person rather than with the effect man's 
activities have on the outer world. In the inner dimension of the person, human 
action is at once both transitory and relatively lasting, inasmuch as its 
effects, which are to be viewed in relation to efficacy and self-determination, 
that is to say, to the person's engagement in freedom, last longer than the 
action itself. The engagement in freedom is objectified - because of its 
lastingly repetitive effects, and conformably to the structure of 
self-determination - in the person and not only in the action, which is the 
transitive effect. It is in the modality of morality that this objectification 
becomes clearly apparent, when through an action that is either morally good or 
morally bad, man, as the person, himself becomes either morally good or morally 
evil.</P>
<P align=justify>In this way we begin to glimpse the proper meaning of the 
assertion that "to perform the action brings fulfillment." Neither performing 
nor fulfillment is identifiable with efficacy. The performing of an action, 
through the fulfillment it brings, is coordinate with self-determination. It 
runs parallel to self-determination but as if it were directed in the opposite 
sense; for being the performer of an action man also fulfills himself in it. To 
fulfill oneself means to actualize, and in a way to bring to the proper 
fullness, that structure in man which is characteristic for him because of his 
personality and also because of his being somebody and not merely something; it 
is the structure of <I>self-governance </I>and <I>self-possession. </I>Implied 
in the intentionality of willing and acting, in man's reacting outside of 
himself toward objects that he is presented with as different goods - and thus 
values - there is his simultaneous moving back into his ego, the closest and the 
most essential object of self-determination. This structure serves as the basis 
of morality - or of moral value as an existential reality - and it is owing to 
it that morality as a modality of conduct participates in the innerness of man 
and achieves a measure of durability in him. It is connected with the 
intransitiveness of actions but it also in a special manner itself constitutes 
the intransitiveness. Human actions once performed do not vanish without trace: 
they leave their moral value, which constitutes an objective reality 
intrinsically cohesive with the person, and thus a reality also profoundly 
subjective. Being a person man is "somebody" and being somebody he may be either 
<I>good </I>or <I>bad.</P></I>
<P align=justify>Morality as the modality of conduct is to a certain extent 
extricable from the interwoven existential whole that it forms together with the 
person. In a way this distinction becomes unavoidable because the whole is too 
intricate to admit of an evenly balanced interpretation simultaneously of the 
person-action structure and of morality, not to mention the whole normative 
sphere that includes the problems belonging to ethics. This is why the usual 
method of ethics is to treat the existential moral reality more or less 
separately, that is, to bracket it. Nevertheless, as an existential reality 
morality is always strictly connected with man as a person. Its vital roots grow 
out of the person. Indeed, it has no existence apart from man's performance of 
actions and his fulfillment through actions. This fulfillment is equivalent to 
the implementation of self-governance and self-possession as the result of 
self-determination. It is only in such a dynamic cycle that morality can be 
concretized in the actual performance of action, as, so to speak, into an 
"actual reality." In its axiological nature morality means the division between, 
or even the contraposition of, good and evil - a specific differentiation of 
moral values - with respect to man; from this point of view it is studied by 
philosophy and presupposed in ethics. But it shows also an ontological status, 
namely, an existential reality, <I>the reality of fulfillment in an action, 
</I>that is appropriate solely to the person. In its axiological nature morality 
is anchored and rooted in the ontological reality - but at the same time it 
inversely unfolds its ontological reality and helps to understand it. This is 
precisely the reason why the experience of moral features of action and of the 
person are so strongly emphasized in this study.</P>

<P align=center>2. <B>THE RELIANCE OF SELF-FULFILLMENT ON THE CONSCIENCE</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Moral Dimension of the Person's Fulfillment in an 
Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We may see at present how action - as well as the fulfillment 
it bnngs about - is connected not only with the outer and transitive effect of 
acting but also with its inner intransitive effect, and has a fundamental 
significance for the interpretation of the person. It also simultaneously opens 
an approach to an interpretation of the conscience, which again only seems 
possible on the assumption that to act stays in a necessary dynamic relation to 
the fulfillment of the person in the action. There seems to be no other possible 
road to an understanding of that specific progress expressing the vitality of 
the conscience, of its purely personalistic sense. Obviously it does not consist 
in a more or less abstract dialectic of the moral values of good and evil but 
reaches with its roots to the ontological status of the personal fulfillment of 
the ego in the action. Man fulfills himself as the person, as "somebody," and as 
such he may become either good or bad, which means that he may or may not 
achieve self-fulfillment.</P>
<P align=justify>With this contraposition we come to view morality as an 
"axiological reality"; for in this perspective existentially every action is 
some kind of fulfillment of the person. Axiologically, however, this fulfillment 
is reached only through the good, while moral evil leads or amounts to, so to 
speak, nonfulfillment. This approach appears somewhat convergent with the view 
that all evil, including moral evil, is a defect. The defect occurs in the moral 
order and thus in the axiological order from which it is instilled into the 
existential-ontological order; for the significance of moral values for the 
person is such that the true fulfillment of the person is accomplished by the 
positive moral virtuality of the action and not by the mere performance of the 
action itself. Morally evil virtualities of action, on the other hand, lead to 
nonfulfillment even though the person is acting. When performing an action the 
person fulfills himself also from the ontological point of view. Thus we come to 
the conclusion that the deepest significance with respect to the real existence 
of morality can be grasped as man's fulfillment, whereas his allegiance to evil 
means in fact nonfulfillment.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Contingency of the Human Person as Revealed by 
Self-Fulfillment</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the ontological perspective man's fulfillment of himself - 
which is achieved every time he acts and concretizes positive moral virtualities 
- shows us the human person to be a potential and not a fully actual being. If 
the human person were to be seen as a "pure' consciousness" constituted of a 
stream of acts, then there would be no possibility whatever of his 
actualization. It seems obvious, however, that the person, the action, and their 
dynamic union are more than merely an enactment of consciousness; indeed, they 
are a reality that exists also apart from consciousness. Since the person acts 
and fulfills himself in and through action, morality evidences a specific 
ontological transitoriness or contingency of the individual real being: man is a 
contingent being. Every being that must strive to attain its own fullness, and 
that is subjected to actualization, appears indeed to be contingent. This seems 
to be evidenced also, in a different way, by the modality of action as seen in 
its axiological status; the possibility of being good or being bad, that is to 
say, of fulfilling oneself through goodness or of nonfulfilling oneself, shows a 
special feature of the contingency of the person. The fact that the person can 
"be" either good or bad is of course the consequence of his freedom, and at the 
same time it reveals and establishes the existence of this freedom. It reveals, 
moreover, that the way this freedom is used may be right but may also be wrong. 
Indeed, man is not unconditionally led to concretize the positive values of the 
moral good in his action; neither does human action as such contain positive 
moral virtualities. Thus he cannot be sure of his freedom. It is precisely in 
this conditionality and this uncertainty that the ethical aspect in the 
contingency of the person consists, and on it rests the significance of the 
consclence.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Action's Dependence on the Recognition of Moral Goodness as 
Revealed by the Conscience</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is also the conscience that reveals the dependence on a 
specific mode of "truth," as we express it in a colloquial way, inherent in the 
freedom of man. The dependence is, as we asserted earlier, the basis for the 
self-dependence of the person, that is to say, for freedom in the fundamental 
sense of autodetermination. Simultaneously this dependence serves as the basis 
for the person's transcendence in the action. The transcendence of the person in 
the action does not consist solely either in the ontological autonomy, or 
self-centered dependence on the ego. It includes also the indispensable and 
essential moment of reference to "truth," and it is this moment that ultimately 
determines freedom. For human freedom is not accomplished nor exercised in 
bypassing truth but, on the contrary, by the person's realization and surrender 
to truth. The dependence upon truth marks out the borderlines of the autonomy 
appropriate to the human person.</P>
<P align=justify>But, in addition, the human person has the "right" to freedom, 
not in the sense of unconditioned existential independence, but insofar as 
freedom is the core of a person's self-reliance that essentially relates to the 
surrender to "truth." It is this moral freedom that more than anything else 
constitutes the spiritual dynamism of the person. Simultaneously it also shows 
us the fulfilling as well as the nonfulfilling dynamism of the person. The 
criterion of division and contraposition is simply the truth that the person, as 
somebody equipped with spiritual dynamism, fulfills himself through reference 
to, and by concretization within himself of, a real good and not otherwise. The 
dividing line, the line of separation and contraposition between good as a 
positive moral value and evil as a negative moral "countervalue," is marked out 
by "truth," the unique type of truthfulness of the good of which man has the 
experience in his conscience. It is the dependence on this truth that 
constitutes the person in his transcendence with respect to the reality of his 
own existential conditions; thus the transcendence of freedom with respect to 
the various existential conditions passes into such a transcendence of morality 
itself.</P><B>
<P align=justify>The Person's Transcendence and its Relation to Truth, Good, 
Beauty</P></b>
<P align=justify>The notion of the "transcendence of the person" may be 
broadened and examined in relation to all the traditionally distinguished 
absolute exponents of values: "truth," "good," and "beauty." Man has access to 
them through knowledge, and in the wake of knowledge, of the mind, through the 
will and through action. In this approach the action serves to approach and 
crystallize the experience of truth, good, and beauty. It is in this perspective 
that action was often examined in traditional metaphysics. The approach to the 
problem by Platonic metaphysics is somewhat different from the Aristotelian 
approach; but for all the differences, some themes remain the common property of 
the different metaphysics and of the anthropologies constructed on their basis. 
The vision of the transcendence of the man-person that is formed through his 
relation to these absolute points of reference does not, however, lose anything 
of its significance, when reference is made to experience - in particular, to 
the experience of morality. For the transcendence of the person understood 
metaphysically is no abstract notion; the evidence of experience tells us that 
the spiritual life of man essentially refers to, and in its strivings vibrates 
with, the reverberations with the experientially innermost attempts to reach 
truth, goodness, and beauty. We may thus safely speak of the role of these 
absolute modes of values that accompany the experience of the personal 
transcendence.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Conscience as the Person's Inner Normative 
Reality</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In this study reference is primarily made to only one dimension 
and one significance of the person's transcendence in the action, namely, the 
transcendence of freedom that also finds its realization in the ethical modality 
of action and person. When man acts, he at once fulfills himself in the action, 
for as a human being, as a person, he becomes either good or evil. His 
fulfillment is based on <I>self-determination, </I>that is to say, on freedom. 
Freedom, on the other hand, carries within itself the surrender to truth, and 
this fact is most vividly brought into prominence in man's conscience. The 
function of the conscience consists in distinguishing the element of moral good 
in the action and in releasing and forming a sense of duty with respect to this 
good. The <I>sense of duty is the experiential form of the reference to (or 
dependence on) the moral truth, </I>to which the freedom of the person is 
subordinate.</P>
<P align=justify>The function of the conscience is essentially more than 
cognitive; it does not consist solely in informing one that "X is good, X is the 
real good" or that <I>"Y </I>is evil, <I>Y </I>is not the real good." The 
appropriate and complete function of the conscience consists in relating the 
actions to the recognition of the truth that has been made known. In this 
relating by awakening appropriate virtualities in the action, the surrender to 
the recognition of the moral good means a simultaneous self-determination and 
surrender of the will to the recognized moral good.</P>
<P align=justify>We thus see that this surrender to the good in truth forms in a 
way a new moral reality within the person. This new reality has also the 
normative factor and manifests itself in the formulation of norms and in their 
role in human actions.S<SUP>2 </SUP>These norms play a specific role in the 
performance of actions and the simultaneous fulfillment of the person in the 
action. The study of the normative factor in the moral reality of the person 
belongs to the sphere of moral philosophy and ethics, but it also extends to 
other domains. Here it suffices to mention that alongside the norms appertaining 
to the moral modality of action, which may be defined as the norms of ethics, we 
find in the integral experience of man the norms of logic, of aesthetics, and, 
perhaps, of still others. Some are connected with the domain of theoretical 
knowledge and theoretical truth, others with the domain of beauty and art. We 
thus see in outline a kind of affiliation of the normative order with, on the 
one hand, the world of absolute types of values and, on the other, the 
diversified activities of man.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Conscience as the Source of Norms of Actions Conditions the 
Fulfillment of the Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The norms of ethics, however, differ from the norms of logic 
and aesthetics, and this difference has always been stressed by traditional 
philosophy. Only the norms of ethics, which correspond to morality, bear upon 
man's actions and upon man as a person. It is through them that man himself as a 
person becomes morally good or evil, with "through" construed as the relation 
based on a compliance or a noncompliance with norms. The norms of logic as well 
as those of aesthetics never have such a strong effect on man, for they are not, 
as Aristotle rightly observed, the norms of acting, of the action, but only of 
knowing or producing. Within their scope they do not refer to man as the person 
but to man's products, to his works. These may also be considered from the point 
of view of the properties of truth or beauty, and they will then prove either 
true or false (wrong), either beautiful or ugly. All the same, to qualify in 
this way a work or a product, even if behind the qualification stands the world 
of norms, is quite a different thing than to qualify - or disqualify - the 
person himself.</P>
<P align=justify>At any rate, it is only in the person that the fulfillment, 
which ontologically corresponds to the structure itself of the person, can be 
achieved. The person finds fulfillment in performing the action and thus in 
attaining his appropriate plenitude or completeness, which in its structure 
conforms essentially the structural condition of self-governance and 
self-possession. In the action the person achieves his own accomplishment by 
becoming "somebody" and the being "somebody" is his manifestation of himself. 
Together with this individual fulfillment - stress is to be laid on "together" - 
or indeed in a direct union with it, comes the fulfillment of the self in the 
axiological and ethical sense, the fulfillment through crystallization of moral 
value. This fulfillment or nonfulfillment depends directly on the conscience, on 
the judgment formed in the conscience. The function of the conscience is thus 
determined by the basic ontological structure of the person and the action - in 
particular, by that dependence of freedom upon truth which appertains to the 
person alone; this is the focus in which the person's transcendence in the 
action and the spirituality of man converge.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>3. <B>CONSCIENCE DEPENDS ON TRUTHFULNESS</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Why Is the Normative Power of Truth Rooted in the 
Mind?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The foregoing analysis leads to the conclusion that fulfillment 
is connected with the inner and intransitive effect of the action. This effect 
causes the acting of man to be arrested and preserved in the person and is 
achieved by means of self-reliance, which is the basis for the structure of 
man's free will and contains in itself the manifest power to subordinate man, 
his will and his actions to the recognized truth. As manifested in man's 
conscience, the capacity to surrender to truth shows how deeply the relation to 
truth is rooted in the potentiality of the personal being of man. It is this 
capacity, with its persuasive and prompting power, that we have in mind when we 
speak of the "rational nature" of man, or when we attribute to his mind the 
ability to know the moral truth and to distinguish it from moral falsehood. The 
mind is commonly regarded as the organ of thought: the function of thinking 
itself and also of comprehending is usually connected with the intellect. In 
fact, the mind is first of all merely a faculty of the man-person. Thinking and 
comprehending are the manifestations of its intellectual function, but besides 
its shaping of means and projecting their relations, its practical function 
consists in the evaluating and distinguishing of what is true and what is not. 
As one of man's faculties and powers, the mind in these two functions allows man 
to keep alive the widest possible contacts with reality. Every being can become 
the object of the mind's concern, and it is not merely cognition but recognition 
of moral truthfulness that is the primordial element in the mind's concern with 
this being.</P>
<P align=justify>Because of its ability to grasp the truth and to distinguish it 
from fallacy, the mind provides the basis for man's peculiar ascendancy over 
reality, over the objects of cognition. This ascendancy forms part of the 
integral experience of the person's transcendence - in particular, of the 
person's transcendence in action, which is the main theme of our present 
inquiry. This is clearly seen in and confirmed by the analyses of Chapter 2. 
Man's consciousness has indubitably a mental character, but even so its proper 
function does not consist solely in searching for truth and distinguishing it 
from fallacy, because this belongs to judgments. Consciousness in its mirroring 
function draws its significative contents from the active intellectual and 
practical processes that are directed toward truth. In this way the state of 
truthfulness also becomes their share and thus consciousness in its reflexive 
function conditions the experience of truthfulness. But as we already asserted 
in Chapter 2, neither the knowledge nor the active evaluation and understanding 
of truth constitute the proper function of consciousness. This must have a 
bearing upon the interpretation of the person's transcendence in the action, in 
particular, in what concerns the function of the conscience, on which in our 
approach the transcendence depends.</P>
<P align=justify>It is the activity of the mind, the whole effort directed 
toward moral truth and not consciousness alone that seems to supply the basis 
for the transcendence of the person. When we speak here of truthfulness, we have 
in mind this effort and man's intellectual activity at its crucial point. The 
grasping of truth is connected with a special striving in which truth as a value 
is the end that is sought. Man strives for truth and in his mind the ability to 
grasp it as a value - by distinguishing it from nontruth - is combined with the 
urge to search and inquire. Already in the striving we see his necessary 
dynamical need for truth as a value. It is the surrendering of the mind with 
regard to truth that conditions the transcendence of the person. Far from being 
but a passive mirror that only reflects objects, man acquires through truth as a 
value a specific ascendancy over them. This "superiority," which is inscribed 
into the spiritual nature of the person,<SUP> 53</SUP> is connected with a 
certain distance or aloofness toward mere objects of cognition. This is 
precisely why the use of reason, or of the mind as the distinctive trait of the 
person, is so rightly stressed in the Boethian definition quoted 
above.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Person's Transcendence and Fulfillment Depend on the 
Truthfulness of the Conscience</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Earlier in this study mention was made of the structural trait 
of the person manifesting itself in self-governance and self-possession. These 
structures are fundamental for the interpretation of the action in its intrinsic 
relation to the person and in its simultaneous transitiveness and 
intransitiveness. The persistence of an action in the person, because of its 
moral value, derives from and depends on the conscience. On the other hand, 
man's conscience is connected with the mind not only by consciousness but also 
by moral truthfulness. It has often been stressed that the function of the 
conscience is to judge of the moral value of an action, of the good or the evil 
contained in the action. This interpretation though correct does not seem to be 
fully satisfactory. It seems impossible to grasp the specific totality of the 
conscience without first outlining the structure of the person, the structure of 
self-governance and self-possession. Against the background of these structures 
we can perceive and interpret the dynamism of self-determination with its 
parallel dynamism of fulfillment - and it is there that conscience is rooted. 
Now, the conscience is the necessary condition of man's fulfillment of himself 
in the action. The man-person, as we already noted, fulfills himself in both the 
ontological and the axiological or ethical sense. In the latter case fulfillment 
follows the surrender to the recognition of the moral goodness while 
nonfulfillment is the result of missing it - and this directly depends on the 
conscience.</P>
<P align=justify>The role of conscience is to experience not only truthfulness 
but also duty, which will now be analyzed. Moral truthfulness, on which the 
sense of duty relies, thus comes to the forefront. When we say judgment is a 
function of the conscience we are referring to what is in a sense the last stage 
of this function and very often its purely formal aspect (this in many cases is 
connected with an intellectualized interpretation of the conscience). Actually, 
the conscience, when considered as a distinctive system, consists in a very 
specific effort of the person aimed at grasping the truth in the sphere of 
values, first of all in the sphere of moral values. At first it is a search for 
and an inquiry into the truth before certitude is reached and becomes a 
judgment. After all, we know all too well that the conscience may falter and 
often be at fault, that it may be in disaccord with the reality of the good. But 
all this is only additional evidence that the conscience has to be closely 
related to truthfulness and not only to consciousness - even though in the light 
of the earlier and the present analyses it seems evident that it is 
consciousness that supplies the judgments of the conscience with the subjective 
experience of truthfulness. Similarly it brings into these judgments the 
experience of certitude. In other situations it will bring the experience of 
incertitude, of a faltering conscience and, at worst, of bad faith or of a 
"false conscience."</P>
<P align=justify>The effort of the conscience itself, so far as it is the task 
of the mind striving for truth in the sphere of values, does not consist in 
theoretical inquiry. On the other hand, it is very closely connected with the 
special structure of the will as self-determination and also with the structure 
of the person. It issues from, and in its own specific manner is aimed at, the 
person. The will, as we know, always has an intentional direction; it is always 
a willing directed to an object that is seen as a value. Such willing is 
consequently not merely a detached intentional act; on the contrary, it has an 
intransitive significance in the person. When willing something even beyond 
myself I thereby also in one way or another bring back the discretion of the 
will upon myself. Since willing is an intentional act, it can never pass 
unheeding by the ego, which in some respects is the ultimate object of the will. 
Freedom conceived of as based in self-reliance is presupposed in the freedom 
that consists in independence from the possible objects of willing. It is with 
this reality of the human will and of human liberty that the effort of the 
conscience is most closely related. When it is an effort of the intellect 
striving for truth in the sphere of values, then its aim is to grasp not only 
any detached values as such of the objects of willing but also - together with 
the intransitiveness of the action - the <I>basic value of the person as the 
subject of the will and thus also the agent of actions.</P><B>
<P align=justify>Normative Power as the Union of Truth and Duty</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The question then arises how to be good and not bad;<SUP>54 
</SUP>how through action to become good and how not to become bad. In so stating 
the substance of the problem we touch upon those normative roots of truthfulness 
which spring from the conscience. Indirectly we also touch upon the essence of 
man's fulfillment of himself, of the fulfillment of the person that in the 
dynamism appropriate to the person runs, so to speak, parallel to 
self-determination. Due to the role of conscience, it is the normative function 
of the evaluated and recognized truth to condition not only the performance of 
an action by the person but also his fulfillment of himself in the action. It is 
in such fulfillment that the structure of self-governance and self-possession 
peculiarly appropriate to the person is confirmed and at the same time acquires 
the status of reality and may be actually functioning. Truthfulness, seen as the 
normative rule of truth put to exercise by the conscience, is like the keystone 
of the whole structure. Without truthfulness (or while out of touch with it) the 
conscience or, more broadly speaking, the whole specific system of the moral 
function and order cannot be properly grasped and correctly interpreted. This 
refers essentially to the norms of morality, inasmuch as it is they that serve 
the performance of the action and the fulfillment of the personal ego through 
the action, while the norms involved only in cognitive and thinking operations 
apply - as we asserted earlier -solely to man's products or works. This is the 
reason why in the present study we are primarily concerned with that normative 
power of truth which appertains to consclence.</P>
<P align=justify>More recently, the students of these problems with an interest 
in far-reaching abstraction have taken as the theme of their analyses only the 
truthfulness or the falsity of normative propositions. Moreover, they have often 
held that no logical value can be assigned to such propositions, inasmuch as 
truth or untruth can be asserted only of propositions with the word "be" in the 
copula but not of sentences with "should" as their syntactic functor.S<SUP>5 
</SUP>This view in no way changes or belittles the statement that conscience is 
that basic experiential reality in which the person manifests (or perhaps even 
reveals) himself most fully to himself and to others. The fact of the 
conscience, for all its subjectiveness, still retains a measure of 
inter-subjectivity; it is in the conscience that there is achieved the peculiar 
union of moral truthfulness and duty that manifests itself as the normative 
power of truth. In each of his actions the human person is eyewitness of the 
transition from the "is" to the "should" - the transition from "X is truly good" 
to "I should do X." Faced by this reality the person never remains unsupported 
by ethics seen either as a philosophical clarification of conduct or wisdom, 
which is both a knowledge and a method of seeking the exact truth. Thus ethics 
is in the right when it sees its main task in justifying the norms of morality 
so as to contribute thereby to the establishment of the truthfulness of the 
human conscience.</P>
<P align=justify>It seems it is now the most appropriate moment to introduce 
ethics into the analysis of the reality constituted by the person and his 
acting.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>4. THE OBLIGATION TO SEEK SELF-FULFILLMENT</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Duty and the Person's Fulfillment in Actions</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The explanation of the normative power of truth is to be sought 
in its reference to the sense of duty, while it also explains the sense of duty 
because of the reference to values. The fact that the assertion "X is truly 
good" activates the conscience and thus sets off what is like an inner 
obligation or command to perform the action that leads to the realization of X 
is most strictly related with the specific dynamism of the fulfillment of the 
personal ego in and through the action. It is from this point of view that duty 
is discussed here, albeit it may also be considered from different angles. Duty 
may be viewed as in a way the consequence of a ready-made and preexistent moral 
or legal principle. This principle we may call a "norm" because of its content, 
which is not only declarative - it cannot be expressed by the copula "be" - but 
obligatory because to be expressed it requires the semantic functor "should" or 
"would." In this approach a duty - regardless of whether it is a moral or legal 
obligation - may appear to be something derived from without the subject-person. 
It then expresses the individual's social obligations toward other people and 
toward the whole society to which he belongs. The person's duties with regard to 
other people present themselves differently; they occur in virtue of an 
interpersonal nexus of "participation" that manifests itself in the personal 
intertwinings of the coexistence and collaboration of people, and will be 
considered separately in a subsequent chapter.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Truthfulness of Moral Norms as Such</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Inherent in all the obligations man has toward other people and 
which are the foundations for the codes of moral and legal norms is the 
presupposition that a duty is a specific interpersonal reality. It is a dynamic 
reality that forms an integral part of acting whereby the person - as we have 
more than once insisted - also finds the fulfillment of himself as a person. The 
state of affairs that in the performance of an action man simultaneously 
fulfills himself through the truth of the action is visualized in the 
conscience. There is a correlation between the conscience as the interpersonal 
source of duties and the objective order of moral or legal norms, the order that 
in its significance and application extends far beyond an individual person and 
his concrete innerness. Nevertheless, the operative role of these norms to 
determine duties derives from the fact that in the social sphere as well as in 
the partly interpersonal and partly suprapersonal dimensions they emphasize 
objectively the good, as relevant to the person which thus takes for him the 
form of an obligation. The fundamental value of norms lies in the truthfulness 
of the good they objectify and not in the generation itself of duties; this is 
so even though the normative formulas used in actual practice accentuate their 
mandatory aspect by such expressions as "necessary," "duty," "must," and so on. 
Nevertheless, the sense of the moral or legal normative sentences lies 
essentially in the truth of the good that they objectify. It is owing to their 
truthfulness that they become related to the conscience, which then, so to 
speak, transforms their value of truth into the concrete and real obligation. 
Such is the case even when the conscience responds as if its acceptance of an 
obligation was based solely on an objective moral or legal norm. We have to 
remember, however, that the truthfulness of the good contained in norms may be 
directly evident, and this then determines the direct acceptance of their 
normative contents by the conscience and furnishes them with their own normative 
power. At other times, when the merits of the case are not as evident, the 
conscience very definitely checks and in its own manner verifies the norms by 
testing, as it were, their truthfulness within its own limits.</P>
<P align=justify>This is due to the fact that truthfulness and duty are strictly 
concomitant; for the real issue is not just an abstractly conceived objective 
truthfulness of norms but experiencing their truthfulness, the kind of 
experiencing that expresses itself in the conviction or subjective certitude 
that such-and-such a norm corresponds to a good. The deeper the certitude the 
stronger becomes the sense of obligation. Experience of obligation is intimately 
united with experience of truthfulness. Often, or indeed almost as a rule, we 
then speak not of <I>truthfulness </I>but of <I>rightness. </I>Theoretical 
judgments may be true or may be false, but norms are right or wrong. The right 
norm is a source of obligations for the conscience, which, conformably with the 
etymology of "obligation" and "to oblige," means to bind the conscience and 
bring it to act in compliance with the precepts of the norm. A right norm is 
thus one that it is proper for the conscience to obey; a wrong norm, on the 
contrary, one that is not to be followed.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Creative Role of the Conscience</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>For all the fitness and adequacy of the attributes <I>right 
</I>and <I>wrong </I>with reference to norms, it seems that they tend to leave 
in the shadow the moment of truthfulness, of the experience of truth as value, 
and (as associated with this experience) the transcendence of the person in an 
act of conscience. There is no question of assigning to the conscience, as Kant 
argued, the power to make its own laws - followed by an identification of this 
power with the notion of autonomy and thus in a way with an unrestricted freedom 
of the person. The conscience is no lawmaker; it does not itself create norms; 
rather it discovers them, as it were, in the objective order of morality or law. 
The opinion that man's individual conscience could itself establish this order 
distorts the correct proportions in the relations between the person and the 
society or community and - on a different level -between the human creature and 
the Creator. Such views are the source of arbitrary individualism and threaten 
to destroy the ontic and ethical balance of the person; in addition, the 
rejection of natural law in ethics leads to similar consequences. At the same 
time, we have to recognize that from the point of view of the integral 
experience of man as a person the function of the conscience cannot be reduced 
to a mechanical deduction or application of norms whose truthfulness inheres in 
abstract formulas, formulas that in the case of established legal systems may be 
codified.</P>
<P align=justify>The conscience plays a creative role in what concerns the 
truthfulness of norms, that is to say, of those principles of acting and 
behavior which form the objective core of morality or law. Its creativity goes 
beyond simple recognition of the norm or injunction that generates the sense of 
obligation resulting in passive obedience. The experience of rightness is 
preceded and integrated by the experience of truthfulness. The latter inheres in 
the acceptance of a norm which occurs upon the <I>strength of the subjective 
conviction. </I>The creative role of the conscience coincides with the dimension 
of the person; it is wholly internal and applies to the acting, as well as to 
the moment of the person's fulfillment of himself. Indeed the creative role of 
the conscience consists in the fact that <I>it shapes the norms into that unique 
and unparalleled form they acquire within the experience and fulfillment of the 
person. </I>The sense of conviction and certitude, whereby the truthfulness of a 
norm is molded within the personal dimension, are followed by the sense of duty. 
Its mandatory power, the normative power of truth within the functioning of the 
person, is intimately related to the conscience and evidences the freedom the 
person has in acting. Far from abolishing freedom, truth liberates it. The 
tension arising between the objective order of norms and the inner freedom of 
the subject-person is relieved by truth, by the conviction of the truthfulness 
of good. But it is, on the contrary, intensified and not relieved by external 
pressures, by the power of injunction or compulsion. This is best formulated in 
St. Paul, in his demand of <I>rationabile obsequium, </I>which is the 
personalistic synonym of obligation.'<SUP>6 </SUP>The use of compulsory measures 
overshadows the transcendence of the person or reflects an immaturity in the 
person. Even if it is impossible to deny that such immaturity may happen, it 
would be inhuman to equate obligation with external pressures.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Transition from Value to Obligation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>There is ample evidence to show that the transcendence of the 
person through freedom is realized in the quest after the value of truth or 
truthfulness. Insofar as truth is the ultimate point of reference for the 
transcendence of the person, the traditional definition of the person is right 
in stressing that this transcendence, especially the transcendence of a person 
in action, has its source in the mind. It seems, however, that - as we already 
noted - the metaphysical reduction implicit in this definition emphasizes the 
intellectual nature (i.e., rational nature) rather than transcendence of the 
person through the relation to the value of moral truth. It is this 
transcendence as the constitutive feature of the person that we are trying to 
disclose in this study. Obligation evidences once again what has already been 
explained in the preceding chapter, namely, that the will and the freedom of the 
person in their own dynamic way surrender to truth, that they have their own 
dynamic relation to truth. This relation determines the specific originality of 
every choice and decision and in a special manner the individual originality of 
the varied instances of duty or obligation. For obligation is in a way a special 
stage in the dynamlzation of the will in its specific reference to truth.</P>
<P align=justify>We are not speaking here - as already stressed - of truth in 
the theoretico-logical sense and not even of that axiological truth which is 
connected with the cognitive experience of value. The cognitive experience of 
values does not necessarily initiate the willing of values, not to mention the 
experience of obligation. If a value is to give birth to obligation it needs 
first to intercept in a special manner, and as a specific appeal, the path of 
the person's acting.</P>
<P align=justify>The passage from value to obligation presents a separate 
problem, which we shall outline here but not analyze in detail. It very often 
has the form of an obligation to abstain from doing something in recognition of 
a value; many of the moral norms are presented in the form of prohibitions, as 
for instance most of the commandments in the Decalogue. This form, however, in 
no way excludes or obliterates their value, but, on the contrary, underscores 
it. Thus, the commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness," accentuates all 
the more strongly the value of veracity, while the commandment, "Thou shalt not 
commit adultery," brings into light the whole system of values connected with 
marriage, the person, the rearing of children, and family life in general. The 
passage from value to obligation in what seems to be the negative way 
characteristic of morality and legislation, is neither the only way nor the most 
important. The positive way seems to have a greater importance. The best and the 
most comprehensive example of obligation initiated by value in the positive 
sense is now and will always remain the evangelical commandment, "Thou shalt 
love." Obligation is then directly released by value with all its intrinsic 
content and all its attractive power. But the content and the attractiveness of 
a value are, so to speak, checked at the threshold of the person's innerness, 
the threshold erected by the conscience, which tests the truthfulness of the 
good presented in the value; it is with this test that obligation begins.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Calling to Self-Fulfillment in Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>An obligation arising in a positive way because of the 
attractiveness and acceptance of values, which are spontaneously or reflectively 
recognized as true, may become a vital manifestation of the person's "calling." 
In recent moral philosophy there seems to be a clear tendency to distinguish 
between or even to oppose the roads leading to obligation: the negative, 
commonly identified (though without sufficient justification) with a system of 
norms conceived primarily as prohibitions, and the positive, identified with the 
attractiveness and the acceptance of values. The latter is usually understood as 
consisting in the "calling" of the person. The issue of a calling or vocation 
deserves in itself a separate investigation, as does the problem of the relation 
of values and norms. But here this issue is approached only from the viewpoint 
of the performance of an action and thus in terms of man's fulfillment of 
himself through action. For it is difficult to deny the objective closeness or 
perhaps even partial overlapping of this fulfillment and the person's calling. 
It seems, moreover, that any obligation, also that to which the passage from 
value is along the negative path, tells in one way or another about the calling 
of the person. For in every obligation there is an imperative: be good as man - 
do not be bad as man. It is in this imperative that the ontological and the 
axiological structures of man as <I>the </I>person come, so to speak, together. 
All other more detailed callings and vocations, or perhaps we may call them 
challenges by values, are ultimately reducible to this first, fundamental 
calling.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Person's Transcendence Evidenced in the Drama of Values and 
Obligations</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The intimate connection between values and obligations reveals 
the human person in his peculiar relation to a broadly conceived reality. This 
relation, as should be perfectly clear by now, is more than that purely 
cognitive one which like a lens focuses the reality in the microcosmos of man. 
The whole cognitive process merely interiorizes, as it were, the extrapersonal 
reality in the subject-person (this reality together with the subject himself is 
in a special manner interiorized by consciousness). 'Whereas, obligation goes in 
the other direction: it introduces the person through his actions into that 
characteristic drama enacted in the context of reality of which it makes of him 
the subject <I>(dramatis persona). </I>On the side of the man-person it is the 
drama of values and obligations. Outside of the drama man cannot fulfill himself 
as a person. Indeed, the fulfillment appears to be the more mature, the more 
profound and radical is the drama of values and obligations in man. Obligation - 
both as an element in the total calling of man and as the concrete content of a 
particular action - appears capable of telling much about the transcendence of 
the person. It brings into view, on the one hand, the reality of this 
transcendence and, on the other, its equally real limits, the limits of the 
reality within which man is to fulfill himself. Being a specific structure of 
self-governance and self-possession the person realizes himself most adequately 
in his obligations. He realizes himself neither by the intentionality of 
volitions nor through self-determination but through <I>his sense of obligation 
as the peculiar modification of self-determination and intentionality.</P></I>
<P align=justify>At the same time, through obligation the person opens himself 
to values while still retaining toward them the measure set out by the 
transcendence that conditions the action and also allows us to distinguish 
acting from what only happens in the man-subject.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=center>5. </I><B>RESPONSIBILITY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Obligation Relates Responsibility to Efficacy</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The analyses so far provide a sufficient ground for grasping 
and interpreting the relation that in man's action exists between efficacy and 
responsibility, in particular for interpreting the notion of "responsibility" 
itself. The relation between the efficacy and the responsibility of the person 
may serve as the framework for establishing the elementary facts on which rests 
the whole moral and legal order in its full interhuman and social dimensions. 
Nevertheless, this relation, like obligation, is in the first place an inner 
reality of the person, a reality that exists within the person. It is only owing 
to this interpersonal reality that we in turn can speak of the social 
significance of responsibility and lay down for it some principles in social 
life. Already the first look at the notion of "responsibility" shows that if we 
want to bring out in full relief its social and interhuman implications, we have 
first to make man himself with his personal structure and his transcendence in 
acting the object of our analysis.</P>
<P align=justify>The very fact that we relate responsibility directly to 
efficacy and can say that "man as the doer of X is responsible for X" reveals 
how complex as well as cohesive and condensed are the elements constituting the 
simple whole contained in the phrase "man performs an action." From our previous 
discussion we see how numerous are the elements which the reality of performing 
an action is composed of on the side of self-determination and parallel to it 
also on the side of fulfillment, the fulfillment that says more of the 
performing person than of the performed action itself. Similarly, responsibility 
informs us primarily about the person performing an action and fulfilling 
himself in the action. Although we have related responsibility directly to 
efficacy, its source is in obligation rather than in the efficacy itself of the 
person. Man can be responsible for X only when he should have done X or, 
conversely, should not have done X. The one is contained in the other inasmuch 
as the way the passage from value to obligation is achieved may be either 
positive or negative. For instance, a man being untrue to others or telling lies 
is responsible for misleading others, and this he should not do because of his 
obligation to truthfulness. The relationship of responsibility with efficacy 
implies obligation.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Responsiveness to and Responsibility for Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The relationship of responsibility and efficacy also indicates 
that there is included in obligation an opening out of the person to values. 
Responsibility, as an intrapersonal fact that man has the experience of in an 
intimate relation with his conscience, seems to presuppose the specific dynamism 
of the will noted in the preceding chapter. The analysis of choice and decision 
with their own originality then led us to the conclusion that the will consisted 
in the ability to respond independently to a value rather than in the ability to 
strive for an object because of its value. The ability to respond to values 
integrates in its own special manner man's acting and impresses it with the mark 
of personal transcendence. Following it comes responsibility, which is most 
intimately connected with the action, because it is action that carries in it 
the response to values that is characteristic of the will. Thus we see outlined 
the response-responsibility relation. 'When man agrees to be responsible for his 
own actions, he does so because he has the experience of responsibility and 
because he has the ability to respond with his will to values.</P>
<P align=justify>This relation presupposes moral truthfulness; it presupposes 
that relation to truth in which obligation is rooted as the normative power of 
truth. And obligation constitutes that mature form of responding to values which 
is most intimately related to responsibility. Responsibility bears within itself 
the element of obligatory reference to values. Thus whenever the sense of 
obligation, an "I should," leads to a response, we have in outline the 
obligation-responsibility relation. Because of obligation the response to values 
characteristic for the will assumes in the person and in his actions the form of 
responsibility for values. Owing to the intentionality proper to the will, human 
actions are, as we know, directed toward various objects, which present 
such-and-such a good or, in other words, such-and-such a value. The important 
thing in human striving is its truthfulness - the striving must correspond to 
the true value of its object. For instance, when a person's action has as its 
object another person, the directing to the object must correspond to the value 
of the person. We have here the obligation to refer to the object in accordance 
with its true value; parallel to it we see the responsibility for the object in 
connection with its value or, briefly stated, the responsibility for values. 
This responsibility is somehow inherent in the formation itself of the 
obligation and itself has its source in this formation. Responsibility is 
conditioned by obligation and, simultaneously, participates in the constituting 
of an obligation.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Subject's Responsibility for His Own Moral Value Is Based 
on Self-Determination</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The responsibility for the value that is appropriate to the 
object of acting is strictly connected with the responsibility for the subject 
himself, namely, for the value that in the course of acting is formed in the 
subject, in the concrete ego. For the first and the most important feature of 
the will is its reference to the ego, the objectification of the ego in acting, 
and not only the intentionality in the reference to objects external to the ego. 
Together with the responsibility for the value of intentional objects, the first 
and fundamental responsibility that arises in acting on the basis of 
self-determination and self-dependence is the responsibility for the subject, 
for the moral worth of the ego who is the agent performing the action. This 
integrated structure of "responsibility for" constitutes a whole, which 
approximately corresponds to what is usually called moral responsibility. It is 
at this point that, through the analysis of responsibility, we can probably see 
most vividly why morality cannot be reduced to some heterogeneous dimensions 
external to the person but achieves its adequate dimension within the person 
himself, within his ontology and axiology. The transcendence of morality as an 
objective order with respect to transient life conditions, which, so to speak, 
outgrows the person, is simultaneously strictly correlated with the 
transcendence of the person. The responsibility for the intentional object of 
acting -and more so for the subject and agent of this acting - manifests an 
intimate relationship with the fulfillment of the self, with the autorealization 
of the personal ego in every action.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of Responsibility to Personal 
Authority</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The whole of the reality constituted by responsibility has 
still another aspect, which we shall here designate as "responsibility to," and 
which presupposes "responsibility for." This other aspect, which is undoubtedly 
inherent in the very essence of responsibility, tells us a great deal about the 
surrender of man to the world of persons. For it lies in the nature of 
responsibility that we are always responsible to somebody and thus to a person. 
The world of persons has its interhuman structure as well as its social 
structure. Within this structure the need to be responsible to somebody is 
obviously one of the sources of power, in particular, of judicial power. The 
world of persons has also its religious structure very distinctly apparent, 
especially extensively articulate in the religion of the Old and New Testaments; 
within this structure the responsibility to somebody assumes the religious 
meaning of being responsible to God. It is a responsibility both in the 
eschatological and in the temporal sense. In the latter sense man's conscience - 
in performing its judicial rather than its directive function, both being 
appropriate to it - assumes a special authority. It is this authority that 
allows us to conceive and to speak of conscience as the "voice of God." In the 
philosophy of religion and also in theology (moral theology) this circumstance 
occupies a key position.</P>
<P align=justify>In our present discussion the fact of responsibility - of being 
responsible to somebody - sheds a new light on the structure itself of the 
person in his relation to the action. Once again we find in this aspect a 
confirmation of the intransitiveness of the action, which means that on the 
basis of efficacy and obligation it is specifically vested in the person. Moral 
truthfulness - the person's proper relation' to moral truth - stands guard not 
only when the action issues forth but also when it penetrates into the person. 
Through the conscience, truthfulness, so to speak, keeps a watch over the roads 
of the transitiveness as well as the intransitiveness of the action. It is this 
innermost and thus most fundamental relation of the person to truth, which we 
have often referred to as truthfulness, that lies at the origin of both 
obligation and responsibility. Responsibility to somebody, regardless of any 
other appropriate relations, develops and is expressed in relation to its own 
subject. I myself am also the "somebody" to whom I feel and am responsible. If 
this elementary form of responsibility were not inherent in the whole dynamism 
of fulfillment, it would be difficult to understand any responsibility whatever. 
The world of persons finds its experiential starting point and foundation in the 
experience of the ego as the person. At the ego-person begins the road which 
leads to other persons seen both in the community of mankind and in religious 
perspectives.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>In His Conscience Man Is Responsible to Himself</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The responsibility to somebody when integrated in the voice of 
the conscience places my own ego in the position of judge over myself. It would 
be difficult to doubt the actual presence of such a judicial function in the 
experience of the conscience. Responsibility to somebody in the sense of 
self-responsibility seems to correspond to the self-dependence and 
self-determination proper to man; it is in this correspondence that the will and 
the freedom of the person is expressed and embodied. As the structure of the 
person which we have described here is centered on self-governance and 
self-possession, these together form the basis of man's self-determination. If 
man as a person is the one who governs and possesses himself, then he can do so 
also because, on the one hand, he is responsible <I>for </I>himself and, on the 
other, he is in some respects responsible <I>to </I>himself. Such a structure of 
the person is, as previously noted, indicative of the specific complexity of the 
man-person. For he is at once the one <I>who governs </I>and the one <I>who is 
governed by himself, </I>the one <I>who possesses </I>and the one <I>who is his 
own possession. </I>He is also <I>the one responsible </I>as well as the one 
<I>for whom </I>and <I>to whom </I>he is responsible.</P>
<P align=justify>Thus the structure of responsibility is the characteristic 
structure of, and appropriate only to, the person.<SUP>57 </SUP>A diminished 
responsibility is equivalent to a diminution of personality. The structure of 
responsibility is also intimately connected with man's acting, with the person's 
action, but not with what only happens in man, unless what only happens is a 
consequence of and thus depends on his acting or nonacting. Moreover, it is 
first appropriate to the person from within; and only because of the primordial 
intersubjective nexus of moral and social participation, coexistence, and 
collaboration within the human world does it become a responsibility <I>to 
</I>somebody. The great problem of the personalistic significance of 
responsibility to God ought to be considered separately in a comprehensive 
theological analysis, but such an enquiry does not fall within the scope of the 
present work.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>6. <B>HAPPINESS AND THE PERSON'S TRANSCENDENCE IN THE ACTION</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Fulfillment as a Synonym of Felicity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The analysis of fulfillment as the reality that in the dynamic 
whole of the person-action relation unrolls parallel to self-determination 
cannot be continued without at least touching upon happiness, that classical 
theme in the philosophy of man. "Happiness" and "felicity" are susceptible of 
subtle distinctions in meaning which do not reduce to differences in degrees of 
intensity. We can sense, however, that "felicity" fits better than "happiness" 
into the general line of our analysis. We may consider this problem here not 
only out of loyalty to a certain philosophical tradition but primarily because 
of its part in the general framework of our discussion. In the notion of 
"felicity" there is something akin to fulfillment, to the fulfillment of the 
self through action. To fulfill oneself is almost synonymous with felicity, with 
being happy. But to fulfill oneself is the same thing as to realize the good 
whereby man as the person becomes and is good himself. We can now see clearly 
the lines joining felicity and the axiological system of the person. Their 
connection is in fulfillment, and it is there that it is realized.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Truth and Freedom as Sources of Felicity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The preceding remarks do not imply that action as the dynamism 
proper to the man-person is <I>eo ipso </I>making man happy, <I>the </I>source 
of man's happiness. We already know that to assert the performance of an action 
implies a twofold effect of the person's efficacy and self-determination, 
namely, the external and the internal, the transitive and the intransitive; the 
sphere of felicity is to be sought in what is internal and intransitive in the 
action, in what is identifiable with the fulfillment of the ego as the person. 
We also know that such fulfillment of the ego is constituted by various aspects, 
which we have been trying to distinguish step by step in our analysis. Two of 
them are connected with each other; they are moral truthfulness and freedom. The 
fulfillment of the person in the action depends on the active and inwardly 
creative union of truth with freedom. Freedom alone, as expressed in the simple 
"I may but I need not," does not seem to be rendering man happy in itself. 
Within these terms freedom is but a condition of felicity, albeit to deprive man 
of his freedom is equivalent to endangering his felicity. Thus felicity has to 
be identified not with the availability of freedom as such but <I>with the 
fulfillment of freedom through truth. </I>To fulfill freedom in truthfulness - 
that is to say, according to the relation to truth - is equivalent to the 
fulfillment of the person. It is the fulfillment that plays the role of creating 
the state of felicity of the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Felicity Derived from the Relation to Others</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Admittedly, it is not an easy matter to consider in isolation 
this most intimate dimension of the person in which he experiences happiness at 
his own unique scale; nor, indeed, to sort it out, first, from the whole network 
of interpersonal and social relations and, second, from the whole multilateral 
system of references to the "world," that is, to nature in the most general 
sense, which includes the many different kinds of beings less developed than, 
and yet necessary to, man. All these relations are in one way or another 
meaningful for the happiness of man, but man's relation to other persons plays a 
special and crucial role. Further on in this study we shall take a closer look 
at the problem of the interpersonal system of mutual participation in each 
person's strivings, modalities of existence and concerns that brings together 
and unites human persons on a specifically personal plane. Experience shows that 
this sort of mutual participation is the source of a special type of happiness. 
It is also on the level of personal participation that - though only by suitable 
analogy - we may interpret felicity in the religious sense, the felicity or 
beatitude that derives from the intercourse with God and the communion with Him. 
A profound understanding of the person is certainly of great significance for 
the understanding and the interpretation of the revealed Christian doctrine on 
the eternal beatitude consisting in the union with God.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Intrapersonal Profile of Felicity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In our discussion we limit ourselves to drawing attention to 
what felicity seems to be in the inner and intransitive dimension of the acting 
person. We limit our account to this dimension in order to be able to better 
understand the other dimension just mentioned. In addition, when in his quest 
for happiness man reaches out beyond himself, the fact of the quest itself seems 
to indicate a special correlation between felicity and his own person. The 
correlation has a dynamic character and is established and realized by the 
action. But its foundations are to be looked for within the person, in the 
freedom and moral truthfulness that are the person's constitutive features, and, 
in that dynamic relation to cognitive truth and action which is rooted in the 
mind. We may perhaps go as far as to say that felicity displays a kind of 
special responsibility with regard to the person, to his structure of 
self-governance and self-possession. This responsibility is so distinct that we 
may speak of the "personal structure of felicity," that would have no meaning 
apart from or outside the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Felicity and Its Reverse Belong to Personal 
Structure</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The personal foundation of felicity implies that it may be 
experienced only by beings who are also persons. It seems impossible to 
predicate felicity of nonpersonal beings even when, like animals, they possess a 
psyche. Indubitably animals feel natural satisfaction and pain, a kind of 
comfort or discomfort felt at the sense level. Felicity - like its extreme 
opposite, which may best be exemplified by "despair" -seems, however, to be the 
exclusive privilege of the person, with that special unique structure of the 
person which has no analogue in the world of nature. It is only in the structure 
of the person that the fulfillment of the ego is achieved through the action, 
but it cannot be extrapolated beyond the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Felicity Is Not Pleasure</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The same reasoning may apparently be followed in establishing 
the principle that allows us to distinguish felicity from pleasure. The dividing 
line runs within the limits of the experiential distinction, which we have been 
referring to from the beginning. It is the distinction between the fact "man 
acts" and the fact "something happens in man." The former involves not only the 
performance of the action according to the principle of self-determination but 
also the person's fulfillment based on the same principle; for 
self-determination always consists in a concrete instance of actualized freedom. 
The actualization of freedom is <I>the </I>dynamic core of the fact "man acts." 
Man's acting - the action - as the actualization of freedom, however, may be in 
accord or disaccord with the conscience, that is to say, with truth in the 
normative sense, and this means that man as the person either fulfills himself 
or he does not. 'What is strictly related to this fulfillment we call felicity 
but not "pleasure"; thus we see that felicity is structurally conjugated with 
the experience of acting and with the transcendence of the person in the action. 
The argument applies similarly to the opposite of "felicity," to despair, which 
is a result of acting contrarily to the conscience and recognition of moral 
truth.</P>
<P align=justify>We would seek in vain for pleasure as the element of this 
integral structure. On the one hand, is it possible to speak of pleasure in 
having a "clear conscience" or in fulfilling an obligation? Indeed, in this case 
we rather speak of joy or satisfaction. The fact that the satisfaction may also 
be pleasurable is only secondary - as the vexation caused by remorse is also 
secondary. But neither pleasure nor vexation is in itself connected with the 
personal structure of the fulfillment of the ego through the action. On the 
other hand, pleasure as well as vexation <I>happens </I>in man. This 
circumstance appears to inhere in the essence of pleasure and to distinguish 
pleasure from the felicity that corresponds to the content of personal 
fulfillment. Felicity points to the <I>personal </I>structure while pleasure can 
be related to what may be viewed as the simply <I>natural </I>structure of the 
individual, with reference to some aspects of the comparison between the person 
and nature made earlier.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Person and the Action Remain within the Sphere of Pleasure 
and Displeasure</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have thus established tentatively what may serve as the 
dividing line between felicity and pleasure. This distinction, however, is not 
easy to make; felicity and pleasure tend to overlap in human experience, so that 
they may be easily confused or mistaken for each other. Such confusions appear 
to be frequent, and we often find felicity being treated as but a form of 
pleasure, or pleasure as a constituent of felicity.<SUP>58 </SUP>The difference 
between them is often treated solely as a matter of intensity or rather of 
depth; pleasure is then thought of as a more superficial or less profound 
experience than felicity. These distinctions are suggested primarily by the 
emotional side of experience of felicity and pleasure. Such, for instance, is 
the stand of Scheler. For others felicity is a spiritual instance while pleasure 
is only sensual or "material." All these views seem to oversimplify the 
problem.</P>
<P align=justify>Actually, the dividing line appears to run along the 
fundamental experience of "man acts" and "something happens in man" and to refer 
to the structures contained in these experiences. Felicity would then correspond 
to the structure of the person and to fulfillment. It would be wrong, however, 
to maintain that pleasure is connected only with what happens in man, for we 
know acting may be accompanied by pleasure or displeasure. We also know acting 
may have, and often has, as its aim to provide oneself or others with pleasure 
and to avoid displeasure; it is these premises that serve as the basis for all 
of the so-called utilitarian ethical systems, not to mention commonplace 
hedonism. In the integral experience of man there is nothing to warrant the 
supposition that the notions of "person" and "action" are to be separated from 
the sphere of pleasure and displeasure. This would be equally unwarranted as to 
separate man as the person from nature. The sense of the distinction drawn here 
does not lie in detaching the person and the action from the sphere of pleasure 
and displeasure; its purpose is to indicate that the performing of the action, 
or rather the personal fulfillment of the ego through the action, is correlated 
with felicity (or its reverse) as something so completely specific that it can 
never be resolved into the pleasure-displeasure elements or can in any way be 
reduced to these elements. It is that specificity and irreducibility of felicity 
which seems to be most strictly related to the transcendence of the person.</P>

<P align=center>7. THE TRANSCENDENCE OF THE PERSON AND THE SPIRITUALITY OF 
MAN</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Various Meanings of "Transcendence"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The concept of "transcendence" has been the leading motif in 
our discussion of the person and the action in this and the preceding chapter. 
When it was introduced in Chapter 3 an explanation was provided of the sense in 
which it would be used in this study. This seemed necessary because the term has 
various meanings. One of these meanings is associated with metaphysics, the 
philosophy of being, and expressed in the absolute status of such general 
notions as being, truth, good, and beauty. None of these notions can be 
contained in a definition indicating either its nearest genus or its specific 
differential traits; for each of them transcends in its substance all species or 
genera under which are subsumed and defined the objects of the known reality. 
Another meaning of "transcendence" is primarily connected with epistemology, or 
more broadly speaking, with the so-called philosophy of consciousness. In this 
sense "transcendence" means reaching out and beyond the subject, which is 
characteristic of certain human acts, or the directing of these acts out of the 
cognizing subject beyond the objectifiable realm. In the preceding chapter we 
called this "horizontal transcendence," distinguishing it from the "vertical 
transcendence" that characterizes the dynamic person-action conjugate.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>"Transcendence" Expresses the Essence of the Experience of 
Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The concept of "vertical transcendence" allowed us to contain 
within a descriptive analytical whole the essence of the experience "man acts." 
In this experience man manifests himself as the person, that is to say, as the 
highly specific structure of self-governance and self-possession. It is in and 
through his acting, in and through the action, that we see him in this highly 
specific structure. Thus the person and the action constitute together an 
intimately cohesive, dynamic reality, in which the action is the manifestation 
and the explanation of the person and the action. This parallelism of 
manifestation and explanation is characteristic for the phenomenological 
method.<SUP>59 </SUP>The concept of the "transcendence," in the sense it has in 
this study, is well fitted to the method; it serves our attempts to interpret 
the inherent essence of the experience "man acts," to objectify that which 
allows the acting person to manifest himself and be visualized as the person. 
Since manifestation comes together with explanation, the concept of 
"transcendence" not only expresses the essence of the phenomenological insight 
in what concerns the person but also explains the person in his dynamic cohesion 
with the action. The phenomenological method in nowise stops at the surface of 
this reality but, on the contrary, allows us to penetrate deep into its content. 
Not only does it allow intuition but it also leads to explanation.</P>
<P align=justify>Against the background of this method the concept of 
"transcendence" serves the understanding of the structure, which manifests 
itself in the whole of the experiential fact "man acts." This is <I>the 
</I>structure of the person. The one who acts <I>is </I>the person and asserts 
himself as "somebody"; and at the same time he even more vividly and more 
completely demonstrates in his acting, in the action, why he deserves to be 
regarded as "somebody." Indeed, he shows himself as having the special ability 
and power of self-governance which allows him to have the experience of himself 
as a free being. Freedom is expressed by efficacy and efficacy leads to 
responsibility, which in turn reveals the dependence of freedom on truth; but 
this relation of freedom to truth constitutes the real significance of the 
conscience as the decisive factor for the transcendence of the person in his 
actions. It is in this way that transcendence determines that special structural 
trait of man as the person which consists in his specific domination of himself 
and his dynamism. This superiority above his actual being that the person 
exhibits leads to self-governance and self-possession. In virtue of his 
self-governance and self-possession man deserves the designation of "somebody" 
regardless of whether he has this distinctive structure actually or only 
virtually. Thus man is somebody from the very moment of his coming into 
existence as also when and if something intervenes and prevents his fulfillment 
of himself in actions, that is to say, if his mature actualization of 
self-governance and self-possession was to be prevented. That the designation 
"somebody" is appropriate to man can be deduced also in an analysis of man's 
being and not only from the experience of the person's transcendence.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Spirituality of Man and the Person's Transcendence in 
Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Thus we come to the conclusion that the evidence of the 
spiritual nature of man stems in the first place from the experience of the 
person's transcendence in the action, which we have been trying to describe and 
analyze. The notion of "spirit" and "spirituality" is often, somewhat 
one-sidedly, identified with the denial of a purely material nature of man. By 
"spiritual" we mean indeed an immaterial factor which is inherently irreducible 
to matter. The interpretation of spirituality through the negation of 
materiality presupposes, however, also a positive view of spirituality itself, 
to be found in the idea of the transcendence of the person. In point of fact, we 
may easily observe that everything of which the person's transcendence in the 
action consists, and which constitutes this transcendence, is in this sense 
spiritual. Since this, as we saw, is within the reach of the phenomenological 
insight, the acceptance of the spiritual nature of man in its authentic 
manifestations is not a result of some abstraction but, if one may say so, has 
its intuitional shape; spirituality is open to intuition as well as to an 
unfolding analysis. This shape, the shape of transcendence, is in concrete that 
of human existence: it is the shape of human life itself. Man as the person both 
lives and fulfills himself within the perspective of his transcendence. Is it 
not freedom, obligation, and responsibility which allows us to see that not only 
truthfulness but also the person's surrender to truth in judging as well as in 
acting constitute the real and concrete fabric of the personal life of man? 
Indeed, it is on them that, as we have more than once endeavored to bring to 
light in our analyses, the entire phenomenological structure of self-governance 
and self-possession is based.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Real Immanence of the Spiritual Element in Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In tracing that expressive whole of the experience of man we 
cannot limit our quest solely to an acknowledgment of the manifestations of 
spirituality without seeking to reach its roots. In point of fact, it appears 
that all the manifestations of the spiritual nature of man lead by the thread of 
their genesis to showing the real immanence of the spirit and of the spiritual 
element in man. Man could not exhibit the spiritual element of his nature had he 
not in some way been a spirit himself. This point of view refers to the 
fundamental principles of understanding the whole of reality: the principle of 
noncontradiction and the principle of sufficient reason. Although assuming these 
cornerstones of the traditional categorical way of grasping the whole of reality 
and man, it seems however that we have gone much farther than traditional 
philosophy in its conception of man, inasmuch as in our analyses we have 
accumulated sufficient evidence of the spirituality of man in the descriptive 
phenomenological sense which also led, even if only indirectly, to the 
ontological level. In the course of gaining an insight into the transcendence of 
the person, we saw how the spirituality of the human being is 
manifested.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Sequence of Comprehensions</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Let us first emphasize that our cognition of the spirituality 
of the human being comes from the transcendence of the person. The sequence of 
our comprehensions in this respect is as follows: to start with, we recognize 
that man is the person; next, that his spiritual nature reveals itself as the 
transcendence of the person in his acting; and finally, that only then can we 
comprehend in what his spiritual being consists. In establishing this analytic 
sequence we have to keep in mind that for a spiritual being like man the person 
is the proper existential foundation; in the evidence of experience we can 
neither detach the person from the spiritual nature of man nor detach the 
spiritual nature from the person. Thus when we speak of "spiritual nature," we 
use the expression as indicating some ontologically grounded permanence of the 
spiritual being.</P>
<P align=justify>Without assuming this permanence of the spiritual element in 
man it would be entirely impossible to understand and explain the discreet and 
yet consistently interrelated manifestations of his spiritual nature. We have to 
keep in mind, however, that the mode itself of existence and acting that reveals 
and crystallizes this element or, to put it differently, that liberates this 
element in man is, as we have noted before, the mode of existence and acting not 
of nature as such but of the person.</P>
<P align=justify>The following general conclusions can now be drawn from our 
investigation. The person can only partly and only in a certain respect be 
identified with nature, namely, only in his "substantiality." As a whole and in 
his intrinsic essence he reaches beyond nature. For the personal freedom 
repudiates the necessity peculiar to nature. But we have to emphasize the 
necessary relation between, on the one hand, humanness or human nature and, on 
the other, personality (being a person) and freedom. We then judge that free 
will belongs necessarily to human nature. Freedom itself is, however, opposed to 
necessity. Thus if we are to speak of the nature of the person, we can do so 
only in terms expressing the need to act freely.</P>

<P align=center>8. <B>THE UNITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE MAN-PERSON</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Phenomenological Intuition and the Unity and Complexity of the 
Man-Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The preceding remarks about the relation of the transcendence 
of the person to the spiritual nature of man impel us to look more closely into 
the problem and to discuss the complexity of man as a corporeal and spiritual 
being - "corporeal" as here used referring to matter and to the material though 
primarily in the metaphysical rather than in the physical sense. Experience - 
seen as accessible in phenomenological intuition - tells us in the first place 
that man is a unity. His unity is also manifested in his dynamism, though in 
this respect we note a striking disparity between acting (the experience "man 
acts") and happening (the experience "something happens in man"), which so far 
has not received a full interpretation and will therefore be considered again in 
later chapters. The disparity in the dynamism of acting and happening does not 
prevent the unity of man as the person but reflects a certain complexity, which 
was already noted in Chapter</P>
<P align=justify>3. The unity of the person is most completely manifested in the 
action, that is to say, through transcendence. But again the person's 
transcendence in the action also shows a certain complexity; the one who 
possesses himself is simultaneously the one who, according to the principle of 
self-determination, is possessed by himself; according to the same principle he 
both governs and is governed by himself. His superiority is correlated with his 
subordination. Each helps to compose the unity of the person.</P>
<P align=justify>This complexity is clearly revealed in the phenomenological 
approach, but the remarkable thing about it is its structure, which is 
manifested first of all as a specific organic unity and not as an unintegrated 
manifold. It is how the complexity manifests itself in the action. The fact that 
in the performance of the action man also fulfills himself shows that the action 
serves the unity of the person, that it not only reflects but also actually 
establishes this unity. In point of fact the analyses in this chapter are meant 
to show that it is owing to the spiritual nature of man that the person's unity 
in the action is manifested and actually established. When speaking of man's 
spiritual nature we are not referring to the set of symptoms that determine the 
person's transcendence in the action but to the real source of all these 
symptoms, to the spiritual element in the human being. The experience we rely 
upon and the analyses we carried out suggest the conclusion that it is this 
element that constitutes the unity of man. Thus the transcendence of the person 
in the action, understood in the phenomenological sense, seems to lead to an 
ontological conception of man in which the unity of his being is determined by 
the spirit.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Spiritual Element Underlies the Spiritual Virtuality of 
Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We hope that our considerations have shown with sufficient 
clarity that the specific dynamism of the person has its source in the spiritual 
element. The dynamism itself is manifested in efficacy and responsibility, in 
self-determination and conscience, in freedom and the reference to truth that 
impresses upon the actions of the person and his being itself a specific 
"measure of goodness." As the source of the specific dynamism of the person, the 
spiritual element must itself be dynamic. Dynamism is, as already demonstrated 
in Chapter 2, proportional to virtuality. We infer from this the presence of the 
spiritual virtuality in man, the powers of his spiritual nature. The correlates 
of these powers are the dynamic reference to moral truth in the cognitive 
function and freedom together with the dynamic dependence of freedom on truth in 
the function of self-determination. The former we equate with the notion of the 
intellect and the latter with that of the will. Hence the powers of the 
intellect and the will seem to be partaking of and exhibiting themselves as a 
spiritual element. They constitute the dynamic conjunction of the person with 
the action. Consequently, these powers contribute creatively to the profile of 
the person, and they themselves bear a distinctly personal stamp. They are not 
reducible to nature. Attributing "spiritual aspect" to the intellect and the 
will may indicate that their appropriate dynamism, their mode of dynamization, 
does not pertain to and remain at the level of nature alone.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Spirituality Determines the Personal Unity of the Corporeal 
Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>This notion ol "spirituality" may serve as the key to the 
understanding of the complexity of man. For we now see man as the person, and we 
see him first of all in his acting, in the action. He then appears in the field 
of our integral experience as somebody material, as corporeal, but at the same 
time we know the personal unity of this material somebody to be determined by 
the spirit, by his spiritual nature and spiritual life. Indeed, the very fact 
that the personal - as well as the ontic - unity of the corporeal man is 
ultimately commanded by man's spiritual factor allows us to see in him the ontic 
composite of soul and body, of the spiritual and the material elements. The 
phenomenological insight does not reveal directly this complexity but only 
brings into prominence the unity of man as the person. We also know that it does 
not obscure the complexity, but on the contrary leads up to it. For once 
attention is focused on the person's transcendence in the action because of his 
spiritual nature, the need immediately arises to understand better not only the 
manifestations of this spirituality but also its ontic basis and roots. Other 
questions then refer to the relation between the spiritual and corporeal, all 
that is visible in man and accessible to sense; for the spiritual is invisible 
and inaccessible to sense, even when in its manifestations it contributes to the 
vividly expressive content of intellectual intuition. Neither efficacy nor 
obligation, responsibility, freedom, nor moral truthfulness are in any way 
accessible to sense and thus they are "immaterial," they are not "flesh," but 
even so they indubitably belong to the experience of man; they are objects of 
intuition as evident data, which the mind can grasp and whose understanding it 
may itself cultivate and develop suitably.<SUP> 60</P></SUP><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experience of Personal Unity Helps to Understand Man's 
Ontic Complexity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Thus the experience of the unity of man as the person 
stimulates the need to understand the complexity of man as a being. Such 
understanding entails extensive knowledge of how to measure the limits or 
perhaps the depth of things. It belongs to metaphysics, in which throughout the 
ages thinkers have been unraveling the nature of man as a being consisting of 
soul and body, of spirit and flesh. It is possible, however, that while 
returning to those arguments and analyses already attempted in this study, those 
reserved for later chapters may shed on them some new light of their own. For 
there is no question but that the conception of man as the person - though it is 
accessible in the original intuition within the frame of phenomenological 
insight - has to be completed and supplemented by the <I>metaphysical analysis 
of the human being. </I>Thus while the experience of the personal unity of man 
shows us his complex nature, the attempt at a deepened understanding of this 
complexity allows us in turn to interpret human nature as the one and ontically 
unique person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experience of the Soul</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is to metaphysical analysis that we owe the knowledge of the 
human soul as the principle underlying the unity of the being and the life of a 
concrete person. We infer the existence of the soul and its spiritual nature 
from effects that demand a sufficient reason, that is to say, a commensurate 
cause. In this perspective it is evident that there can be no such thing as a 
direct experience of the soul. Man has only the experience of the effects which 
he seeks to relate with an adequate cause in his being. Nevertheless, people 
often think and speak of the soul as something of which they have had an 
experience. But in fact the content of what is meant as the "experience of the 
soul" consists of everything that in our previous analyses was attributed to the 
person's transcendence in the action, namely, obligation, responsibility, 
truthfulness, self-determination, and consciousness. It is the innerness of all 
these moments, however, that is most vividly manifest in this experience; they 
make the vital fabric of the inner man, they inhere in his inner life, and as 
thus experienced they are identified with the experience of the soul. But the 
possible knowledge of the soul is not limited solely to these moments and their 
specific role; it encompasses in and through them man's entire, as it were, 
spiritual ego. Thus the possible knowledge of the soul as the spiritual ego of 
man seems in its own way to point out the direction of metaphysical 
analysis.</P></FONT>
