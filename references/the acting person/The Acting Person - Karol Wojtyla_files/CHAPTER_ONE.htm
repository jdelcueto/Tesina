<P align=center>THE ACTING PERSON IN THE ASPECT</P>
<P align=center>OF CONSCIOUSNESS</P>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>1. THE HISTORICAL WEALTH OF THE EXPRESSION "HUMAN ACT"</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Act in Its Traditional Interpretation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Before embarking upon a discussion of the act and the person it 
is first necessary to look, however briefly, into a question that has but the 
semblance of purely terminological significance. It is only man's <I>deliberate 
acting </I>that we call an "act" or "action." Nothing else in his acting, 
nothing that is not intended and deliberate deserves to be so termed. In the 
Western philosophical tradition a deliberate action has been seen as the 
<I>actus humanus, </I>the human act, with the stress laid on the aspect of 
purpose and deliberateness; it is in this sense that the term is used, even if 
implicitly, throughout this book, since only man can act purposely and 
deliberately.'<SUP>0 </SUP>The expression "actus humanus" itself is not only 
derived from the verb <I>agere </I>- which establishes its direct relationship 
with action and acting because <I>agere </I>means to act or to do - but it also 
assumes, as it is traditionally used in Western philosophy, a specified 
interpretation of the action, namely, the interpretation found in the 
philosophies of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas. The interpretation is 
realistic and objectivistic as well as metaphysical. It issues from the whole 
conception of being, and more directly from the conception of <I>potentia 
-actus, </I>which has been used by Aristotelians to explain the changeable and 
simultaneously dynamic nature of being.<SUP>11</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Here we are concerned with the concrete being that is man, with 
his own proper mode of acting. The specific mode of man's acting is precisely 
the reason why in Scholastic philosophy the action is defined as <I>actus 
humanus </I>or, more precisely, as <I>actus voluntarius. </I>Such action is the 
concretion of the dynamism proper to man, insofar as its performance is 
conformable with the free will. The feature indicated by the attributive 
<I>voluntarius </I>is the decisive factor in the inherent essence of action as 
well as for its separateness from the acting of any other subject that is not a 
person. In the light of the Aristotelian conception as interpreted by the 
Scholastics, the peculiar aspect of the term <I>actus </I>is its close link with 
a corresponding <I>potentia. </I>This points to the potential substratum of 
actualization; it explains why <I>actus humanus </I>considers man as the subject 
who acts; less directly, it accounts for his potentiality as the source of 
acting. The same is accomplished with still greater precision by the expression 
<I>actus voluntarius, </I>which points directly to the power that serves as the 
dynamic basis in conscious acting, the basis of action. The power in question is 
the free will. The attribute <I>voluntarius </I>also tells us how the action is 
accomplished, namely, that it is "voluntary" -which means there is nothing to 
interfere with the actualization of the free will.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Action as Peculiar to the Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Nevertheless, the term "human act" or "action" as such contains 
a definite interpretation of action as conscious acting, which is strictly 
connected with the philosophy of being. In its own way this interpretation is 
correct. It accounts for the experiential facts as a whole and brings out most 
meaningfully all that is essential in them. In a sense we may even say no other 
interpretation of human action is possible; for it seems there is no conception 
better suited for grasping both the thoroughly dynamic nature of human actions 
and their intimate association with the human being as a person. It seems, 
moreover, that any attempt at dealing with this problem, any attempt that 
strives to attain the full meaning of all its essential elements and 
constitutive interrelations, must in one way or another acknowledge the 
philosophical content hidden in the terms "human act" and "voluntary act." The 
same philosophical content is assumed also in the attempt undertaken in this 
study. Nevertheless, in the course of our considerations we shall have to 
scrutinize and unfold these assumptions further and reexamine them in their 
various aspects. For the moment it suffices to say that the historical 
conception tends to assume the human person as the source of action: whereas the 
approach of this study is from the opposite side, and aims to bring into full 
view precisely that which is only assumed in the classic conception of the 
"human act"; for indeed, as we have pointed out before, action may also serve as 
a source of knowledge of the person.<SUP>12 </SUP>Action as such - that is, as 
the human action - ought to be helpful in the cognitive actualization of the 
potentiality, which it takes for granted as its roots. But the potentiality is 
that of the personal being, so that action is to be interpreted not only as the 
human action but also as the action of the person. In approaching the person 
through his actions we shall have to retain that philosophical intuition which 
appears to be indispensable for the comprehension and the philosophical 
interpretation of any dynamism and thus also of the dynamism of action, that is, 
of conscious acting. Since, then, the fullest and most comprehensive 
interpretation of that dynamism is the only way of bringing into view the whole 
reality of the person, the provision of such an interpretation shall be our main 
objective.</P>
<P align=justify>When so defined, <I>action </I>is identical in meaning with 
human action; the noun <I>action </I>is related to the verbs <I>to act </I>and 
<I>to do. </I>"Action," in the sense it is used here, is equivalent to the 
acting of man as a person. While "human act" shows such action as a specific 
manner of becoming based on the potentiality of the personal subject, the terms 
<I>act </I>or <I>action </I>themselves tell us nothing about it. They seem to 
denote the same dynamic reality but, in a way, only as a phenomenon or 
manifestation rather than as an ontic structure. It does not mean, however, that 
they prevent us from gaining access to this structure. On the contrary, both 
<I>action </I>and <I>conscious acting </I>tell us of the dynamism proper to man 
as a person. It is owing to this intrinsic content that they comprise all that 
is meant by "human act"; apparently philosophical thought has so far failed to 
develop a more fundamental concept for expressing dynamism apart from the 
concept of <I>actus.<SUP>13</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=justify>Voluntariness as Indication of Consciousness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>By ''action'' is meant acting consciously. When we say 
''conscious acting" we implicitly refer to the kind of acting that is related to 
and characteristic of the will. Thus the phrase to some extent corresponds to 
the <I>actus voluntarius </I>of Scholastic philosophy, since any acting 
pertaining to the human will must also be conscious. We can now see even more 
vividly how condensed is the meaning of "action" or of the corresponding 
"conscious acting" of everyday speech. In it are contained the ontological 
meanings, which belong to the <I>human act, </I>as well as the psychological 
meanings, which are traceable in such attributives as the Latin <I>voluntarius 
</I>or the English <I>conscious. </I>Hence the notion of <I>action </I>contains 
a great wealth of implications, which will have to be gradually extricated and 
explicated. Simultaneously, our explication will gradually disclose that reality 
of the human person; indeed, it is the object of this study to uncover and 
gradually to expound the notion of action from the point of view of the reality 
of the human person. That aim we shall strive to achieve step by step, keeping 
in mind the organic integrity of the concrete action in its relation to the 
person. This gradual approach is, indeed, the direct consequence of the very 
conception of an "aspect"; an aspect may never stand for the whole and may never 
put it out of view. If it is substituted for a whole, it ceases to be but an 
aspect, and unavoidably leads to errors in the conception we form of any 
composite reality. But it is precisely such a complex reality that we have in 
the acting person. We cannot for a moment forget the existence of this 
complexity and the ensuing epistemological principles when we embark upon the 
analysis of the person and his action by examining first, the aspect of 
consciousness and second, that of efficacy.</P><B>
<P align=center>2. THE ATTEMPT TO DISCERN CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE "HUMAN 
ACT"</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Is this Analysis Possible and Necessary?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The concept of "conscious acting" brings us to envisage the 
aspect of consciousness in an action but does not precisely identify it. It is 
first necessary to recognize the difference between conscious acting and the 
consciousness of acting; the aspect of consciousness will then come into view, 
as it were, in itself. The distinction, when we make it, allows us to gain a 
direct access to consciousness, thus enabling us to examine it in greater detail 
- though obviously we must continue to take account of the function which it 
performs in the acting as well as in the whole existence of the person. For man 
not only acts consciously, but also has the consciousness that he is acting and 
even that he is acting consciously. This is apparent in the fact that 
''conscious'' and ''consciousness'' have two different applications: one is used 
attributively, when reference is made to conscious acting; the other is employed 
as a noun, which may be the subject, when the reference is to the consciousness 
of acting. Our discussion will henceforth concentrate on the consciousness of 
acting and consequently on the consciousness of the acting person; hence our aim 
will be to disclose its relationship with the person and the action. It is only 
in this connection that consciousness as such will be considered. When, on the 
other hand, we speak of conscious acting - without stressing the 
<I>consciousness </I>of acting - then we point only to action, to its 
constitutive feature that proceeds from cognition. What is implied here is the 
kind of cognition that makes the action also voluntary, which means that it is 
performed according to the will; for cognitive objectivation is assumed in the 
correct functioning of the will. It now becomes clear why the expression 
''conscious acting'' says nothing directly of the consciousness of acting. It 
is, however, possible and even necessary to discern, in that dynamic whole, 
consciousness as such, and to examine it as a special aspect. Since we shall be 
concerned throughout this study with conscious acting an examination of the 
consciousness itself of acting, which is the theme of this chapter, may throw 
new light on the whole dynamic system of person and action.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point the question may, or even should, be asked why 
the aspect of consciousness is discussed in the first chapter, that is, why the 
discussion of the consciousness of acting precedes the discussion of efficacy, 
though it is efficacy that makes of conscious acting the <I>action </I>of the 
person. Why in our analysis do we first consider what is secondary and not what 
is fundamental in our conception of action? The question cannot be answered in 
advance; a possibly full and detailed explanation will emerge only in the course 
of our inquiry. At any rate, if we first undertake an analysis of the 
consciousness of acting, we shall be better able to disclose the ground for the 
analysis of efficacy, to extend, as it were, the range of the analysis, and at 
the same time to draw in sharper contour the image of action as the dynamism 
which best expresses the human person as such. Needless to say, even when 
considered in a position of priority, the analysis of consciousness refers also 
to efficacy - as well as to the whole human dynamism - and permanently 
presupposes it. I do not intend to enter here into an analysis of consciousness 
as such and in itself, but only in its strict association with the dynamism and 
efficacy of the human being, just as in the reality of the human experience the 
consciousness of acting is strictly associated with acting consciously. The 
singling out of consciousness as a separate object of investigation is only a 
methodical operation; it is like taking a term out of brackets in order thereby 
to gain a better understanding of what remains bracketed. That is precisely the 
reason why in the title of this chapter mention is made not of consciousness 
alone but of the person and his acting in the aspect of consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>How Is Consciousness Implied in the Human Act?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The traditional interpretation of action as human act implies 
consciousness in the sense earlier Crefined as attributive: <I>human </I>is 
equivalent to conscious acting. It is in this sense that <I>consciousness 
</I>is, so to speak, completely merged in the <I>voluntarium, </I>in the 
dynamism of the human will. This interpretation neither isolates nor develops 
the aspect of consciousness. But consciousness as such, consciousness in the 
substantival and subjective sense, because it permeates deep into the whole 
person-action relation and because in itself it is an important aspect of this 
relation, may be perceived by itself in conscious acting. It is this aspect that 
not only reflects the existence of the person as well as his actions, but also 
fashions them in a specific manner. Let us note, however, that although in the 
traditional conception of human act this aspect was not entirely disregarded, 
its presentation was vague, and, as it were, only implied in 
it.<SUP>14</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>The traditional conception of <I>actus humanus </I>was in fact, 
as we already remarked, a tributary, not only of an epistemologically realistic 
position, but also of a metaphysical standpoint. It conceived consciousness as 
something that was incorporated and subordinate, as if it was dissolved in man 5 
actions and in his being, the being of the rational nature; though man existed 
and acted consciously, it was not in consciousness that his being and acting had 
their specific origin. In this connection we have to keep in mind that our own 
stand on that question is also clearly against any tendency to attribute 
absolute significance to consciousness. We want, however, to bring out and, so 
to speak, to expose the fact that consciousness constitutes a specific and 
unique aspect in human action. Whereas in the Scholastic approach, the aspect of 
consciousness was on the one hand only implied and, as it were, hidden in 
"rationality" (this refers to the definitions, <I>homo est animal rationale 
</I>and <I>persona est rationalis naturae individua substantia); </I>on the 
other hand it was contained in the will (understood as <I>appetitus rationalis) 
</I>and expressed by <I>voluntarius. </I>The task set out in this investigation 
is to go farther and to exhibit consciousness as an <I>intrinsic and cons 
titutive aspect of the dynamic structure, </I>that is, <I>of the acting 
person.</P></I>
<P align=justify>Indeed, man not only acts consciously, but he is also aware of 
both the fact that he is acting and the fact that it is he who is acting - hence 
he has the awareness of the action as well as of the person in their dynamic 
interrelation. His awareness is simultaneous with conscious acting and, so to 
speak, accompanies it. But it is also present before and after. It has its own 
continuity and its own identity separate from the continuity and the identity of 
any particular action.'<SUP>5 </SUP>Every action finds consciousness, if one may 
say so, already there; it develops and comes to pass in the presence of 
consciousness, leaving behind little trace of its passage. Consciousness 
accompanies and reflects or mirrors the action when it is born and while it is 
being performed; once the action is accomplished consciousness still continues 
to reflect it, though of course it no longer accompanies it. The accompanying 
presence of consciousness is decisive in making man aware of his acting rather 
than in making his acting conscious. Again, it is its presence that makes him 
act as a person and experience his acting as an action, the role of the aspect 
of consciousness being manifested most appropriately in the latter. This is 
precisely what we shall now strive to expound.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>In what Sense Is "Consciousness" Used Here?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Although it is true to say that in the ultimate analysis the 
function of consciousness is cognitive, this statement describes its nature only 
in a very general way; for in this function consciousness seems to be only a 
reflection, or rather a mirroring, of what happens in man and of his acting, of 
what he does and how he does it. (The distinction between what <I>happens </I>in 
man and what he <I>does </I>is of great importance in all our future discussion 
of action and will be fully examined in the next chapter.) Consciousness is also 
the reflection, or rather the mirroring, of everything that man meets with in an 
external relation by means of any and all of his doings - also cognitive - and 
all the things happening in him. This is all mirrored in consciousness. 
"Contained" in it, so to speak, there is the whole man, as well as the whole 
world accessible to this concrete man - the man who is me, that is, myself. How 
is all this "contained" in consciousness? The question is important and the 
answer is that whatever consciousness "contains" is held by it in its own 
specific manner. We shall now seek to define that "specific manner."</P>
<P align=justify>It lies in the essence of cognitive acts performed by man to 
investigate a thing, to objectivize it intentionally, and in this way to 
comprehend it. In this sense cognitive acts have an intentional character, since 
they are directed toward the cognitive object; for they find in it the reason 
for their existence as acts of comprehension and knowledge. The same does not 
seem to apply to consciousness. In opposition to the classic phenomenological 
view, we propose that the cognitive reason for the existence of consciousness 
and of the acts proper to it does not consist in the penetrative apprehension of 
the constitutive elements of the object, in its objectivation leading to the 
constitution of the object.<SUP>16 </SUP>Hence the intentionality that is 
characteristic for cognitive acts - to which we owe the formation, and an 
understanding, of the objective reality on any of its levels - does not seem to 
be derived from acts of consciousness. These are not essentially intentional by 
nature, even though all that is the object of our cognition, comprehension, and 
knowledge is also the object of our consciousness. But while comprehension and 
knowledge contribute in an intentional way to the formation of the object - it 
is in this that consists the inherent dynamism of cognizing - consciousness as 
such is restricted to mirroring what has already been cognized. Consciousness 
is, so to speak, the understanding of what has been constituted and 
comprehended. The purport of the preceding remarks is that the <I>intrinsic 
cognitive dynamism, </I>the <I>very operation of cognition, does not belong to 
consciousness. </I>If acts of cognition consist in constituting in a specific 
way the meanings referring to cognitive objects, then it is not consciousness 
that constitutes them, even if they are indubitably constituted also in 
consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>It seems, therefore, impossible to deny the cognitive 
properties or even the cognitive function of consciousness, though the nature of 
the properties and the function is specific. What we may perhaps call the 
"consciousness trait" is peculiar to the particular acts of consciousness as 
well as to their current totality, which may be viewed as the sum or the 
"resultant" of those acts and which we usually simply refer to as consciousness. 
As ''consciousness'' we understand then "reflecting consciousness" - that is, 
consciousness in its mirroring function. If we see it as if it were the 
derivative of the whole actively cognitive process and of the cognitive attitude 
to the external reality, like the last "reflection" of the process in the 
cognizant subject, it means that we recognize this reflecting or mirroring as 
possible insofar as we attribute to consciousness the specific quality of 
penetrating and illuminating whatever becomes in any way man's cognitive 
possession. (But such penetrative illumination is not tantamount to the active 
understanding of objects and, subsequently, to the constituting of their 
meanings.) If we are to keep to this description, the penetrative illumination 
is rather like keeping objects and their cognitive meanings "in the light," or 
"in the actual field of consciousness."</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Consciousness Is not an Autonomous Subject</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Obviously the aim of our present discussion is not to elaborate 
a complete and finished theory of consciousness. To deny the intentional nature 
of the acts of consciousness seems to be contrary to most contemporary opinions 
on that issue. Looking at consciousness, however, we see it not as a separate 
and self-contained reality but as the subjective content of the being and acting 
that is conscious, the being and acting proper to man. Disclosing consciousness 
in the totality of human dynamisms and showing it as the constitutive property 
of action we strive to understand it, but always in its relation to the action, 
to the dynamism and efficacy of the person. This manner of seeing and 
interpreting consciousness - consciousness in what we call the substantival and 
subjective sense - protects us from conceiving it as an independent, 
self-contained subject. Indeed, to recognize that consciousness is an 
independent subject could pave the way to a conception of it in absolute terms 
and consequently would lead to idealism, if it were taken as the sole subject of 
all the contents - which would then be nothing but an expression of its own 
doing (thus, <I>esse = percipi). </I>This line of reasoning, however, lies 
beyond the scope of the present considerations. Our concern here is solely with 
consciousness considered from the point of view of the person and his 
existential efficacy; it is this consciousness that we are striving to describe 
when we speak of the mirroring and illuminating function peculiar to both the 
particular acts of consciousness and to the resultant of those acts.</P>
<P align=justify>It is necessary nevertheless to note that the sum or resultant 
of the acts of consciousness determines the actual state of consciousness. The 
subject of this state, however, is not consciousness itself but the <I>human 
being, </I>of whom we rightly may say that he is or is not "conscious," that he 
has full or limited consciousness, and so on. Consciousness itself does not 
exist as the "substantive" subject of the acts of consciousness; it exists 
neither as an independent factor nor as a faculty. A full discussion of the 
arguments in support of this thesis is the task of philosophical psychology or 
anthropology and lies beyond the scope of the present enquiry. Nevertheless, 
from what was already said of the nature of the consciousness it is clear that 
it is entirely dissolved in its own acts and in their specific character of 
"being aware"; and though this specific character is connected with the 
mirroring function it is a different thing from cognitive objectivation. Indeed, 
it is not only cognitively that man enters into the world of other men and 
objects and even discovers himself there as one of them: he has also as his 
possession all this world in the image mirrored by consciousness, which is a 
factor in his innermost, most personal life. For consciousness not only reflects 
but also <I>interiorizes </I>in its own specific manner what it mirrors, thus 
encapsulating or capturing it in the person's ego. Here, however, we come to 
another and supposedly a deeper function of consciousness, which we shall have 
to discuss separately. We shall then have to answer the question how this 
interiorization may be accomplished by the mirroring and illuminating functions 
of consciousness, which we have identified in the preceding analysis. At any 
rate, our investigation brought us closer to the conscious aspect of action and 
at the same time of the conscious aspect of the person. We have found that 
consciousness of action differs from an action conceived as consisting in 
<I>acting </I>consciously. The consciousness of an action is a reflection, one 
of the many mirrorings, which make up the consciousness of the person. This 
reflection belongs by its very nature to consciousness and does not consist in 
the objectivation of either the action or the person, even though it carries 
within itself a faithful image of the action as well as of the person.</P>
<P align=justify></P><B>
<P align=center>3. CONSCIOUSNESS AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Consciousness Conditioned by Its Reflecting 
Function</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>From what we have said so far we gather that consciousness 
mirrors human actions in its own peculiar manner - the reflection intrinsically 
belongs to it - but does not cognitively objectivize either the actions or the 
person who performs them, or even the whole "universe of the person," which in 
one way or another is connected with man's being and acting. Nevertheless, the 
acts of consciousness as well as their resultant are obviously related to 
everything that lies beyond them, and especially to the actions performed by the 
personal ego. This relation is established by means of the consciousness, which 
is constituted by the meanings of the particular items of reality and of their 
interrelationships. When we speak of the aspect of consciousness that refers to 
meanings, and at the same time state that consciousness as such has no power of 
cognitive objectivation, we come to the conclusion that the whole of human 
cognition - the power and the efficacy of active comprehension - closely 
cooperates with consciousness. Consciousness itself is thus conditioned by this 
power and efficacy - it is conditioned, so to speak, by the cognitive 
potentiality, which conformably with the whole Western philosophical tradition 
appears as a fundamental property of the human person.</P>
<P align=justify>The power and the efficacy of active understanding allows us to 
ascertain the meaning of particular things and to intellectually incorporate 
them, as well as the relations between them, "into" our consciousness. For to 
"understand" means the same as to "grasp" the meaning of things and their 
interrelations. Insofar as all this is alien to consciousness the whole process 
of active comprehending neither proceeds in it nor is owing to it. The meanings 
of things and of their relations are given to consciousness, as it were, from 
outside as the product of knowledge, which in turn results from the active 
constitution and comprehension of the objective reality and is accumulated by 
man and possessed by him by various means and to different degrees. Hence the 
various degrees of knowledge determine the different levels of 
consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>All the forms and kinds of knowledge which man acquires and 
possesses and which shape his consciousness with respect to its content, that is 
from the side of objective meanings, have to be distinguished from what we call 
"self-knowledge." There is no need to explain that self-knowledge consists in 
the understanding of one's own self and is concerned with a kind of cognitive 
insight into the object that I am for myself. We may add that such an insight 
introduces a specific continuity to the diverse moments or states in the being 
of the ego,'<SUP>7 </SUP>because it reaches what constitutes their primary 
unity, which comes from their being rooted in the ego. Hence it is not 
surprising that self-knowledge more than any other form of knowledge must be 
consistent with consciousness; for its subject matter is the ego, with which - 
as will be fully demonstrated in the course of further analysis - consciousness 
remains in an intimate subjective union. At this point self-knowledge and 
consciousness come closest together, but, at the same time, they deviate from 
each other, since consciousness, for all the intimacy of its subjective union 
with the ego, does not objectivize the ego or anything else with regard to its 
existence and its acting. This function is performed by acts of self-knowledge 
themselves. It is to them that every man owes the objectivizing contact with 
himself and with his actions. Because of self-knowledge consciousness can mirror 
actions and their relations to the ego. Without it consciousness would be 
deprived of its immanent meanings so far as man's self is concerned - when it 
presents itself as the object - and would then exist as if it were suspended in 
the void. This situation is postulated by the idealists, because it is only then 
that consciousness may be viewed as the subject producing its own subject matter 
regardless of any factors outside of it. Had we pursued this line of thought we 
might be led to ask whether consciousness should not be regarded as a real 
subject or even whether it, so to speak, does create itself. As already noted, 
however, such questions are of only peripheral interest in the present 
study.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Consciousness Opened to the Ego by Self-Knowledge</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Owing to self-knowledge the acting subject's ego is cognitively 
grasped as an object. In this way the person and his action have an objective 
significance in consciousness. The reflection or mirroring by consciousness, 
which is not only subjective but also constitutes the basis for subjectivation 
(about which more will be said later), does not abolish the objective meaningful 
constituents of the ego or of its actions; rather, it derives them continuously 
from self-knowledge. The coherence of self-knowledge and consciousness has to be 
recognized as the basic factor of the equilibrium in the inner life of a person, 
especially so far as the intellectual structure of the person is concerned. The 
"subject" man is also the "object"; he is the object for the subject, and he 
does not lose his objective significance when mirrored by consciousness. In this 
respect self-knowledge seems prior to consciousness, and cognitively relates it 
to the ego and its actions, even if consciousness in itself were not 
intentionally directed toward them. At the same time, self-knowledge sets, so to 
speak, a limit to consciousness, the limit beyond which the process of 
subjectivation cannot proceed.</P>
<P align=justify>What is more, the objectivizing turn of self-knowledge toward 
the ego and toward the actions related to the ego is also a turn to 
consciousness as such, so far as consciousness also becomes the object of 
self-knowledge. This explains why, when man is conscious of his acting, he also 
knows he is acting; indeed, he knows he is <I>acting consciously. </I>He is 
aware of being conscious and of acting consciously. Self-knowledge has as its 
object not only the person and the action, but also the person as being <I>aware 
</I>of himself and <I>aware </I>of his action. This awareness is objectivized by 
self-knowledge. Thus the objective meaning in what consciousness reflects 
appertains not to any being or any acting of the person who is my own self, but 
solely to the being and the acting that involves consciousness and of which I am 
aware. Man has the self-knowledge of his being conscious and because of it he is 
aware of the consciousness of his being and acting. But the process does not 
extend indefinitely; the limit to the reflecting of consciousness is set by 
self-knowledge. If, on the one hand, it provides the basis for this mirroring - 
because it forms the content of consciousness - then on the other hand, it marks 
out the boundary circumscribing its own sphere owing to which consciousness is 
established in the existence of man, and ascertains itself as immanent in the 
being instead of spiralling away in an unending sequence of 
"self-subjectivations."</P>
<P align=justify>Earlier in this discussion we emphasized the point that 
conscious-. ness itself was to be seen neither as an individual subject nor as 
an independent faculty. The subsequent analysis has shown even more clearly that 
what we understand by "consciousness" has at its roots the same cognitive 
potentiality as that to which man owes all the processes of comprehension and 
objectivizing functions. It springs from the common stock of this potentiality, 
emerging, as it were, from the background of the processes of comprehension and 
objectivizing cognition; but at the same time, it appears to be seated more 
deeply inside the personal subject. It is precisely the reason why, as it seems, 
all interiorization and subjectivation is the work of consciousness - of which 
more will be said later.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Knowledge as the Basis of Self-Consciousness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>That man can be aware not only of his own self and of the 
actions related to it but also of the consciousness of his actions in relation 
to the ego appears as the work of self-knowledge. In such phrases as "It is how 
I became conscious of my action" or "I became conscious of... this or that," we 
speak of an actualization of a conscious process, though in fact we mean an 
actualization of a self-knowing process; for consciousness itself cannot make us 
aware of anything, because this can be achieved only intentionally, that is, by 
an act of cognition. Nevertheless, since consciousness is intimately united with 
cognition, we have expressed ourselves correctly.</P>
<P align=justify>It is highly symptomatic and not without reason that we have 
these two terms in our vocabulary. They bring order into many problems of a 
noetic as well as of an ontological nature and clarify, on the one hand, the 
objective aspect of the subject and, on the other, that composite and complex 
structure of the subject's nucleus which is the ego. It is this subjectiveness 
of the object that we shall now have to analyze. But before we begin we must 
stress once again that what is meant when speaking of "being conscious of an 
action" is not just the reflection itself in consciousness of a conscious act 
but intentional self-knowledge. By this phrase we mean that by an act of 
self-knowledge I objectivize my action in relation to my person. I objectivize 
the given essential constituent of my action in the actual <I>acting </I>of my 
person and not of what would only <I>happen </I>in my person; furthermore, my 
acting is a conscious event (thus indirectly equivalent to the exercise of the 
free will), and thus, by being performed according to the will, may have a moral 
value, positive or negative, and so is either good or evil. All this which is 
constitutive of the action and objectivized by an act of self-knowledge becomes 
the "content" of consciousness. This objectivation allows us to see the 
objective sense of consciousness, that is, the relation of consciousness to the 
"objective" world. We may thus speak of consciousness from an "objective point 
of view" by virtue of the meanings of the different objects through which it 
manifests itself. But we may speak of consciousness from the objective point of 
view also in a more specific manner with respect to the meaningful structure 
appertaining in consciousness to the ego, to its mode of being and operations 
spreading through a radius of interconnectedness. This sense, or more strictly 
speaking, this set of senses, consciousness owes to self-knowledge. Because of 
its various senses consciousness appears also in a special modality of 
"self-consciousness." It is self-knowledge that contributes to the formation of 
self-consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Specific Position of Self-Knowledge in the Totality of 
Human Cognition</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Having outlined the interrelation existing between 
consciousness and self-knowledge we shall now - before carrying on our analysis 
of consciousness and in particular of self-consciousness - briefly consider 
self-knowledge as such. In our approach to the problem we will for the moment 
ignore the functions of consciousness, as if the concrete ego were nothing else 
but the object of its own cognition, that is, of self-knowledge.</P>
<P align=justify>The preceding analysis has shown that every man's ego 
constitutes, in a way, a meeting point where all the intentional acts of 
self-knowledge concentrate. This is the knowledge that at the very point 
constituted by the objectified ego meets everything in any way connected with or 
in any way referring to the ego. Hence we have, for instance, moral 
self-knowledge, which precedes fundamentally the science of morals, not to 
mention ethics; we have also religious self-knowledge prior to anything we know 
of religion and theology; or again, there is the social self-knowledge 
independent from what we know about society, and so on. Self-knowledge is 
concentrated on the ego as its own proper object and accompanies it to all the 
domains to which the ego itself extends. Nevertheless, self-knowledge never 
objectivizes any component of these domains for its own sake but solely and 
exclusively because of and in relation to the ego.</P>
<P align=justify>From the preceding remarks we now see more or less clearly that 
the function of self-knowledge is opposed to any "egotistic" approach to 
consciousness, to any approach that would tend to present consciousness (even if 
only vicariously) in the guise of the "pure ego" -the subject. Nor has 
self-knowledge anything in common with an objectivizing cognition that would be 
concerned with an abstracted and generalized ego, with any sort of egology. To 
self-knowledge the object is the concrete ego itself, the self as such. Indeed, 
there may be even some question whether "knowledge," which strictly speaking has 
a general object, is the right term in relation to self-knowledge;'<SUP>8</SUP> 
for self-knowledge not only has as its object the unique, individual ego, the 
self, but is also permanently and inextricably entangled in the details 
referring to the ego. In our analysis we have in focus "self-cognition" rather 
than "self-knowledge." It consists in the acts of objectivizing penetration of 
the ego with all its concreteness and its concomitant detailedness, which yields 
to no generalization whatever. But even so, it is still the real knowledge of 
oneself as an integral whole; for it is not restricted only to the recording of 
details that have a bearing upon the ego but continuously strives after 
generalizations. Such generalizations are, for instance, all the opinions one 
has of oneself or judgments of oneself, which belong to self-knowledge, and it 
alone can form them. It is to be noted, however, that these opinions - any 
overall view of the ego - are mirrored in consciousness; thus, not only are the 
singular data which have a bearing upon the ego mirrored in consciousness but, 
in addition, the continuously developing overall complex that the ego keeps on 
unfolding. In the opinions about this complex there is never just one 
self-knowing theory of one's own ego, for they also have an axiological 
character, which varies with respect to different moral points of view, the 
aspect of value being of no less importance for self-knowledge.</P>
<P align=justify>Self-knowledge is not just a specific instance of the knowledge 
of the human being in general, even though the ego, which it strives to 
objectivize as comprehensively as possible, is, both from the ontological and 
intentional points of view - as the object of self-knowledge -a human being. 
Nevertheless, all the cognitive work it performs proceeds solely from 
self-experience to self-understanding but does not go as far as to include any 
generalizations about man as such. There is in our cognition a subtle but 
precisely marked out boundary between the knowledge of man in general and 
self-knowledge, the knowledge of the ego. The knowledge of the ego, however, 
might in its concreteness come prior to the knowledge of man. Yet it draws upon 
it, because self-knowledge of my very self makes use of all I know about man in 
general, that is to say, of different opinions about the human being I might 
hold or only know about, as well as of the cognition of concrete men, in order 
to gain a better understanding of my own ego and the ego as such. But it does 
not resort to the knowledge of its own self for a better understanding of other 
men or of the human being in general. The knowledge of man, in general, turns to 
the resources of self-knowledge to obtain a deeper insight into its own object. 
Self-knowledge, on the contrary, as we have mentioned takes the knowledge of man 
into consideration, but in its direct orientation stops at the ego and keeps to 
its singular specific cognitive intention; for it is in the ego that man always 
finds fresh material for cognizing himself. The old adage says, <I>individuum 
est ineffabile.</P></I><B>
<P align=center>4. THE TWOFOLD FUNCTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF 
SUBJECTIVENESS</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Mirroring and Experience</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The analysis of self-knowledge gives us a better understanding 
of that function of consciousness which we have assigned to it previously, 
namely, the function of mirroring; in this respect consciousness is not 
restricted to a simple mirroring of everything that constitutes the object of 
cognition and knowledge - and specially the object of self-understanding and 
self-knowledge - but it also in its own peculiar manner permeates and 
illuminates all it mirrors. We do not mean by that to deprive consciousness of 
its specifically characteristic cognitive vitality.<SUP>19 </SUP>In point of 
fact, all that has been said here about self-knowledge may lead to the false 
impression that the reflecting or mirroring function of consciousness may appear 
lost in self-knowledge, in the objectivizing processes of self-comprehension, 
which concentrates on the ego as the object. The question may then well be asked 
whether in view of the prominent role assigned to self-knowledge there are any 
reasons for the distinctive existence of consciousness at all. This question 
leads to another, of a methodological nature: how has the conception of 
consciousness here outlined been reached, and, particularly, how did we come to 
the conception of the relation of consciousness to self-knowledge? Obviously, 
these questions are of paramount significance in view of both the foregoing 
remarks and the forthcoming analyses.</P>
<P align=justify>To answer them it is necessary to recall that in this study the 
approach to consciousness is founded on experience, which allows for the 
objectivation of the full human dynamism, in particular the dynamism already 
referred to in the title of <I>The Acting Person. </I>Thus the interpretation of 
consciousness in its relation to self-knowledge already assumes, albeit 
antecedently, the total, overall conception of the man-person, which we intend 
to develop in the course of this study. In that approach the decisive factor for 
unraveling the problem of the consciousness-self-knowledge relation seems to be 
the question of the objectiveness and the simultaneous subjectiveness of man. 
Consciousness is the "ground" on which the ego manifests itself in all its 
peculiar objectiveness (1)eing the object of self-knowledge) and at the same 
time fully experiences its own subjectiveness. We thus have emerging into view 
the other function of consciousness, as if another trait of it, which in the 
living structure of the person complements the permeative and illuminative 
function of mirroring, and in a way endows consciousness with the ultimate 
reason for its presence in the specific structure of the acting person.</P>
<P align=justify>Attention was already drawn on more than one occasion to the 
fact that the tasks of consciousness do not end with its illuminative and 
reflecting function. In some respects this function might appear primary but not 
unique. In fact, the essential function of consciousness is to form man's 
experience and thus to allow him to experience in a special way his own 
subjectiveness. This is precisely why, if we are also to understand the "acting 
person" and the "action" issuing from the person <I>so far as this constitutes 
an experience </I>- hence in the experiential dimension of the person's 
subjectiveness - we cannot restrict our analysis of consciousness solely to its 
mirroring. The task of consciousness does not end with the reflecting of an 
action in its relation to the ego - this takes place as if on the outside but 
proceeds into the inner dimension. The mirror of consciousness gives us a yet 
deeper insight into the interior of actions and of their relation to the ego, 
and it is only there that the role of consciousness comes into full view. 
Consciousness allows us not only to have an inner view of our actions (immanent 
perception) and of their dynamic dependence on the ego, but also to 
<I>experience these actions as actions and as our own.</P></I>
<P align=justify>It is in this sense that we say man owes to consciousness the 
subjectivation of the objective. Subjectivation is to some extent identifiable 
with experiencing; at least, it is in experience that we become aware of it. 
While constituting a definite reality which as the object of self-knowledge 
reveals itself in its own peculiar objectiveness, the acting person, owing to 
his consciousness, also becomes "subjectified" to the extent to which 
consciousness conditions his experience of the action being performed by him as 
the person, and thereby secures the experience had of the person in its 
dynamically efficacious relation to action. But then, everything that 
constitutes the intentional, objective "world" of the person also becomes 
subjectified in the same way. This "world," with its objective content, may be 
analyzed also in its image mirrored in consciousness. But it is then, if it 
becomes the material of experience, definitely incorporated into the sphere of 
the individual subjectiveness of every human ego. Thus, for instance, a mountain 
landscape cognitively reflected in my consciousness and the same landscape in my 
experience based on this reflection become superimposed on each other, albeit 
they also subtly differ from each other.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Experience of the Ego Conditioned by the Reflexive Function of 
Consciousness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In connection with all that has been said so far we have now to 
mention a new trait of consciousness, one with a new, distinctly separate 
function, which differs from the illuminative, reflecting function already 
described, and thus having a constitutive significance. We call it <I>reflexive 
</I>and assume it appertains to consciousness itself as well as to what the 
so-called actual state of consciousness is composed of, to that specific 
resultant of acts of consciousness. This state of consciousness points not only 
to the mirroring and all that is reflected or mirrored at any given moment, but 
also to experience, in which the subjectiveness of man, as the subject having 
the experience, gains a special (1)ecause experiential) prominence. It is in 
this sense that the <I>reflexive trait </I>or <I>reflexiveness </I>of 
consciousness denotes that consciousness, so to speak, turns back naturally upon 
the subject, if thereby the subjectiveness of the subject is brought into 
prominence in experience.</P>
<P align=justify>The reflexiveness of consciousness has to be distinguished from 
reflection proper to the human mind in its cognitive acts. Reflection 
presupposes the intentionality of these acts, their cognitive direction upon the 
object. If we consider the activity of the mind at the level of abstract 
"thinking," then we might say that "thought" becomes reflective when we turn 
toward a previously performed act in order to grasp more fully its objective 
content and possibly also its character, course, or structure. Thus reflective 
"thought" becomes an important element in the development of all understanding, 
of all knowledge, including the knowledge of the ego. Hence reflection 
accompanies and serves consciousness. But reflection and reflectiveness are of 
themselves insufficient when it comes to constituting an experience. This 
necessitates a special turning back upon the subject, and it is to this turn 
that we owe, along with experience, the emphasized subjectiveness of the 
experiencing ego. It is this particular mode of the constitutive function as 
proper to consciousness that we define as "reflexive," whereby we mean that it 
directs everything back upon the subject. In this perspective we speak of the 
<I>reflexiveness </I>and not the reflectiveness of consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>The function of consciousness, in which it turns back upon the 
subject, differs from the mirroring and reflecting when the self-knowledge of 
man, who is the subject and the ego, is present as the object. The consequence 
of the reflexive turn of consciousness is that this object - just because it is 
from the ontological point of view, the subject - while having the experience of 
his own ego also has the experience of himself as the subject. In this 
interpretation we also understand by "reflexiveness" an essential as well as 
very specific moment of consciousness. It is, however, necessary to add at once 
that this specific moment becomes apparent only when we observe and trace 
consciousness in its intrinsic, organic relation to the human being, in 
particular, the <I>human being in action. </I>We then discern clearly that it is 
one thing to <I>be </I>the subject, another to <I>be cognized </I>(that is, 
objectivized) as the subject, and a still different thing to <I>experience 
</I>one's self as the subject of one's own acts and experiences. (The last 
distinction we owe to the reflexive function of consciousness.) This 
discrimination is of tremendous import for all our further analyses, which we 
shall have to make in our efforts to grasp the whole dynamic reality of the 
acting person and to account for the subjectiveness that is given us in 
experience.</P>
<P align=justify>Indubitably, man is more than just the subject of his being and 
his acting; he is the subject insofar as he is a being of determinate nature, 
which leads to consequences particularly in the acting. Man approached as a type 
of being, that is, from the ontological point of view, appears - in 
contradistinction to processes, events, and ideas -as an autonomous, 
self-centered individual being. In this fundamental notion, abstraction is made 
from that aspect of consciousness owing to which the concrete man - the object 
being the subject -experiences himself as the distinctive subject. It is this 
experience that allows him to designate himself by means of the pronoun <I>L 
</I>We know <I>I </I>to be a personal pronoun, always designating a concrete 
person. However, the denotation of this personal pronoun, thus also of the 
<I>ego, </I>appears more comprehensive than that of the autonomous individual 
being, because the first combines the moment of experienced subjectiveness with 
that of ontic subjectiveness, while the second speaks only of the latter, of the 
individual being as the ground of existence and action.<SUP>20 </SUP>Obviously, 
the present interpretation of the ego relies upon the conception of 
consciousness being unfolded here, as does its relation to man as the real 
subject. We may even say that it implies the reflexiveness of consciousness; for 
if we detach that experience of our subjectiveness, which is the ground for my 
saying, "I am the ego," from the real subject that this particular ego is, then 
this experiential ego would represent nothing but a content of consciousness. 
Hence the fundamental significance of the reflexive turn of consciousness upon 
the real subject, whereby consciousness co-constitutes it in its own dimension. 
It is thus that the ego is the real subject having the experience of its 
subjectiveness or, in other words, constituting itself in consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Ego Constituted as the Subject</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>What has been said so far clearly shows that conformably with 
the epistemological assumptions made in the introduction it is impossible to 
detach the experiential ego from its ontological foundations. The present 
analysis of consciousness ought even to have grounded the ego on a more secure 
ontic basis of its own. Every human being is given in a total or simple 
experience as an autonomous, individual real being, as existing and acting. But 
every man is also given to himself as the concrete ego, and this is achieved by 
means of both self-consciousness and self-knowledge. Self-knowledge ascertains 
that the being, who objectively is I, subjectively constitutes my ego, if it is 
in it that I have the experience of my subjectiveness. Hence not only am I 
conscious of my ego (on the ground of self-knowledge) but owing to my 
consciousness in its reflexive function I also experience my ego, I have the 
experience of myself as the concrete subject of the ego's very subjectiveness. 
Consciousness is not just an aspect but also an essential dimension or an actual 
moment of the reality of the being that I am, since it constitutes its 
subjectiveness in the experiential sense. This being, which in its ontic 
structure is basically a real individual object, would never without 
consciousness constitute itself as the ego. It seems that this is how we have to 
interpret the manner in which consciousness is incorporated into the ontological 
structure of the being that is man if we are to bring out in the correct 
proportions his subjectiveness, that is, the subjectiveness that makes of every 
concrete human being the unique, individual ego.</P>
<P align=justify>It is perhaps worth considering still another aspect of the way 
that our discussion of consciousness leads from its mirroring function to 
experience, and not inversely, as is current in present-day philosophy. 
Consciousness, as we view it here, is a specific dimension of that unique real 
being which is the concrete man. That being is neither overshadowed by nor 
absorbed in consciousness, albeit this would be the case according to the 
fundamental tenet of idealistic thought that <I>esse </I>equals <I>percipi; 
</I>for idealists maintain that "to be" is the same as to be constituted by 
consciousness, and do not recognize any mode of being apart from consciousness 
and consciousness alone.<SUP>2 </SUP>Our approach to the matter however is the 
opposite: consciousness in intimate union with the ontologically founded being 
and acting of the concrete man-person does not absorb in itself or overshadow 
this being, its dynamic reality, but, on the contrary, discloses it "inwardly" 
and thereby reveals it in its specific distinctness and unique concreteness. 
<I>This disclosing is precisely what the reflexive function of consciousness 
consists in. </I>We may even say that owing to the reflexive function of 
consciousness man's being is directed, as it were, "inward," but still maintains 
the full dimensions of his rational essence. Being directed "inward" is 
accompanied by experiencing, and is, to some extent, identical with experience. 
In this interpretation an experience is seen as manifesting more than a reflex 
that appears as though on the surface of man's being and acting. Indeed, 
experience is that specific form of the actualization of the human subject which 
man owes to consciousness. Because of it the actual "energies" which we discover 
through action in man as a type of being - the energies, which, when taken 
together, constitute the multifarious and differentiated wealth of his 
virtualities - are actualized according to the pattern of subjectiveness proper 
to man as a person (more will be said of this in further chapters). Moreover, 
while so actualized they receive in experience their final, so to say, 
subjective shape.<SUP>22 </SUP>Later we shall see that this is not equally true 
of all human energies.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experiential Manifestation of Human 
Spirituality</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Consciousness, as long as it only mirrors and is but a 
reflected image, remains objectively aloof from the ego; when, however, it 
becomes the basis of experience, when experience is constituted by its 
reflexiveness, the objective aloofness disappears and consciousness penetrates 
the subject shaping it experientially every time an experience occurs. 
Naturally, the mirroring and the shaping of the subject are accomplished in 
different ways: to mirror consciousness one retains the objective meaning of the 
subject - its so to speak objective status - but one shapes the ego in the pure 
subjectiveness of experience. This is very important. On the one hand, the 
functional duality in consciousness allows us to remain within the limits of our 
subjectiveness without losing the actual objectiveness in the awareness of our 
being. On the other hand, the fact that our experience is formed because of 
consciousness, that without consciousness there is no human experience - though 
there may be different manifestations of life, different actualizations of human 
virtualities - is in its own way explained by the attribute <I>rationale 
</I>from the Aristotelian conception and definition of man, or by the Boethian 
conception and definition of man as <I>rationalis naturae individua substantia. 
</I>Furthermore, consciousness opens the way to the emergence of the spiritual 
enactment of the human being and gives us an insight into it. The spiritual 
aspect of man's acts and action manifests itself in consciousness, which allows 
us to undergo the experiential innerness of our being and acting. Although it 
seems that the foundations, or rather the roots of human spirituality, lie 
beyond the direct scope of experience - we only reach them by inference - 
spirituality itself has its distinctive experiential expression shaping itself 
through the complete sequence of its manifestations. This is brought to light in 
the intimate and in a way constitutive relation between experience proper to man 
and the reflexive function of consciousness. Indeed, man's experience of himself 
and of everything making him up, of all his "world," is necessarily occurring in 
a rational framework of reference, for such is the nature of consciousness, and 
<I>it </I>determines the nature of experience as well as man as an experiencing 
being.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Consciousness and the Experience of Action in the Dimension of 
Moral Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>How does man have the experience of himself in action? We 
already know he is conscious of himself as the one who acts, as the subjective 
agent of action. A separate question concerns how we are to understand the 
mirroring of the action in consciousness when it extends beyond the subjective 
sphere of man and is, so to speak, enacted in the external world. But even then 
man has the experience of his actions within the limits of his own 
subjectiveness and this experience, like any other, he owes to the reflexive 
function of consciousness. He experiences an action as acting, as doing, of 
which he is the subjective agent and which is also a profound image and 
manifestation of what his ego is composed of, what it actually is. He draws a 
strict distinction between his acting and everything that only takes place or 
<I>happens </I>in his ego. Here the difference between <I>actio </I>and 
<I>passio </I>has its first experiential basis. The distinction itself cannot be 
but the deed of self-knowledge; it belongs to the significative aspect of the 
mirroring function of consciousness. But it is also present in experience: the 
human being experiences his acting as something thoroughly different from 
anything that only happens, anything only occurring in him.</P>
<P align=justify>It is also only in connection with his acting (that is, action) 
that man experiences as his own the moral value of good and bad (or as is 
sometimes wrongly said, of the moral and immoral). He experiences them in the 
attitude he assumes toward them, an attitude that is at once emotional and 
appreciative. At any rate, he is not only conscious of the morality of his 
actions but he actuajly experiences it, often very deeply.</P>
<P align=justify>Objectively, both action and moral values belong to a real 
subject, that is, to man as their agent, from a point of view equally formal as 
existential; simply, they exhibit in their being the derivative type of reality 
that is in a specific manner related to and dependent on the subject. 
Simultaneously, both the action and its corresponding moral value - goodness or 
badness - function, if we may say so, in a thoroughly subjective manner in 
experience - which consciousness conditions by its reflexive function rather 
than only mirroring it because of self-knowledge, for this would still give but 
an objectified awareness of the action and its moral value.<SUP>23 </SUP>As is 
to be seen, both functions of consciousness participate in this remarkable drama 
of human innerness, the drama of good and evil enacted on the inner stage of the 
human person by and among his actions. Thus consciousness, owing to its 
mirroring function closely related to self-knowledge, allows us, on the one 
hand, to gain an objective awareness of the good or evil that we are the agents 
of in any particular action - while, on the other hand, it enables us to 
experience the good or evil in which its reflexiveness is manifested. As already 
noted, this experience is by no means merely an added or superficial reflexing 
of an action or of its moral qualification as good or evil. On the contrary, 
what we are considering here has a reflexively inward direction that makes of 
the action itself as well as of the moral good or bad the fully subjective 
reality of man. In the human subjectiveness they get their, so to speak, 
finishing touches. It is then that man has the experience of good or evil simply 
in himself, in his ego; he thereby experiences himself as the one who is either 
good or evil. So we come to see the full dimension of morality in the subjective 
and personal reality.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>How Does the Ego Help in Understanding Man?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The "full dimension" is also the dimension of that experience 
in which the good and the evil, as the moral values of a person, as well as the 
acting person himself become the object of comprehension or exfoliation; indeed, 
this exfoliation is always becoming more and more profound, a point already 
asserted in the introductory remarks to this study. Mention was there made that 
the experience of the human being and of morality served as the ground for an 
unraveling of the nature of both one and the other. This experience and this 
exfoliation was unquestionably broader than either the self-experience or the 
simultaneously developing self-comprehending contained in experiencing one's 
ego. The question we then asked was whether this self-experience (that is, 
experiencing of one's self) and the self-comprehending that developed with it 
(that is, the awareness of the self based on self-knowledge) were at all 
transferable to that ever expanding sphere of man's experience of things 
external to the ego. This of course is a significant question. We took it up 
again in our discussion of self-knowledge, and now we have to consider it once 
more. For there is no denying that the sphere of self-experience and 
self-comprehending serves as a privileged vantage point, a point specially 
productive of meanings in experience and in the understanding of man. That is 
why, while retaining all the specific uniqueness of self-knowledge (see the 
preceding section) as well as of the experience had of the ego, we strive in one 
way or another to draw our knowledge of man from the source of self-experience 
and self-knowledge. This happens presumably because from the very start we take, 
as it were, a double stance: beginning "inside" ourselves we go out of our ego 
toward "man" and at the same time we proceed from "man" back to the ego. Thus 
our knowledge of man proceeds as if in cycles. This course of the cognitive 
process is obviously valid, if the object of our cognition is not to be our ego 
alone but also the human being - all the more so if the human being is among 
others "myself," when he is also my ego.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>5. THE EMOTIONALIZATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Element of Consciousness and the Emotive Element in 
Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We now have to consider a particular problem, which should be 
preceded by a brief reference to its broader context. But as the full 
presentation is deferred to a later chapter, here, as in the rest of the present 
analysis of consciousness, some account is necessary of things discussed later 
in greater detail. The problem we will now examine is that special area of human 
vitality which has its origin in the emotive element of his psychic processes. 
We know that man's conscious actings, his actions, are on the one side dependent 
in different ways on the functioning of the emotive element of man's psychic 
life, and on the other side generate it and are themselves constituted by it to 
some degree. The free exercise of the will, which has an essential significance 
for actions, is variously modified by this side of the human psyche. These 
modifications are of great import for our investigation into the person and his 
actions. First, however, we have to look at them as an aspect, or perhaps a 
dimension, of consciousness - of consciousness such as we have shown it here, as 
if it were isolated and brought to the forefront of our argument.</P>
<P align=justify>Consciousness reflects man's ego as well as his actions; but, 
at the same time, it allows him to have the experience of the ego, to have the 
experience of himself and of his acting. His body is somehow engaged in the one 
just as in the other. Man is conscious of his body, and he also experiences it; 
he has the experience of his corporality just as he has of his sensuality and 
emotionality. These experiences are linked with the mirroring function of 
consciousness and hence are also guided by self-knowledge, whose participation 
is easily noticeable in a certain abstractness of what becomes the content of 
consciousness and is subsequently experienced. After all, to have the experience 
of one's body is not the same thing as to have the experience of one's 
corporality. The difference lies in the degree of the mental abstraction which 
pertains to the process of comprehension and, in relation to the ego, to the 
process of self-knowledge. Self-knowledge builds that significative aspect of 
the image we have of ourselves in our consciousness which is transferred in the 
operation of the reflexive function of consciousness to experience and which 
determines its content. In the acts of self-knowledge man, with the support of 
self-experience, gains an understanding of his ego both in details and as a 
whole. As to the comprehension of the body, self-knowledge - and with it 
consciousness - relies to a great extent on the particular bodily sensations. We 
know that neither the organism, with all its composite inner structure, nor the 
particular vegetative processes going on in it are - generally speaking - the 
object of self-knowledge or consciousness. Self-knowledge, and with it 
consciousness, reaches only as far, or rather as deep, into the organism and its 
life as sensations allow it to reach. Very often, for instance, owing to 
disease, which activates the corresponding bodily sensations, man becomes aware 
of one of his organs or of a vegetative process within himself. Generally, the 
human body and everything associated with it becomes the object of sensations 
first and only subsequently of self-knowledge and consciousness. "First" and 
"subsequently" do not necessarily indicate an actual time sequence; they are 
used in the sense of the natural adequacy of the object and of the subjective 
acts. The experience of the body has as its counterparts acts of sensation 
rather than acts of comprehension, of which in a way consciousness is built up. 
Nevertheless, man not only feels his body, but he is also aware of it.</P>
<P align=justify>The world of sensations and feelings in man, who is a feeling 
and not only a thinking creature, has an objective wealth of its own. To some 
extent this wealth corresponds to the structure of the human being as well as of 
the external world. The differentiation of feelings is not merely quantitative 
but also qualitative, and in this respect they come in a hierarchical order. 
Feelings of qualitatively "higher rank"</P>
<P align=justify>participate in man's spiritual life. In a further chapter we 
shall deal separately with the analysis of emotions as a specific component of 
the human psychic life. It is common knowledge that the emotional life of man 
exerts a tremendous influence in the formation of his actions. It is also well 
known and corroborated by numerous treatises on ethics that emotions may in some 
respects enhance our actions, but in others they have a restraining or even 
crippling effect on what in acting is essential, namely, the exercise of the 
free will. The participation of the free will in acting is restricted to action 
insofar as it is seen as conscious. Indeed, in this chapter we are concerned 
with conscious acting - hence also with the exercise of the free will - in the 
aspect of its being conscious.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>What Does the Emotionalization of Consciousness Consist 
in?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is only in this aspect that we shall attempt an analysis of 
the influence exerted by the emotive element. Our discussion is thus limited to 
one aspect only without aspiring to anything like a total view. We are concerned 
with what we have agreed to call the "emotionalization of consciousness," that 
is to say, the specific influence of the emotive element on the consciousness of 
acting. (Obviously, this influence cannot be without significance for the whole 
dynamism of the human person, for his conscious acting, for 
action.)<SUP>24</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>The essence of the problem consists in this, that emotions - 
the different forms in which emotive facts occur in man as the subject -are not 
only reflected in consciousness but also affect in their own specific way the 
image that is formed in consciousness of various objects, including, of course, 
man's ego and his actions. Diverse feelings emotionalize consciousness, that is 
to say, they blend with its two functions - mirroring and reflexiveness - 
thereby modifying in one way or another their character. This is first 
manifested in the image formed in consciousness, which, so to speak, loses its 
aloofness with regard to emotion and the objects that emotion is attached to. As 
was demonstrated in previous analyses, this aloofness of consciousness is due to 
self-knowledge, which to some extent p05sesses the power to objectify emotions 
and feelings. In this way the meaning of the emotive facts taking place in the 
subject becomes accessible to consciousness, and thus it can maintain its 
objectivizing aloofness from them and from the objects they refer to. While 
emotions themselves occur or happen in man, he is aware of them, and owing to 
this awareness he can in a way control them. The control of emotions by 
consciousness has a tremendous significance for the inner integration of man. 
Obviously, the sway consciousness exerts over emotion is not achieved outside 
the sphere of the will and without its cooperation. Hence it is only against the 
background of such control that we can form moral values. We are thus faced with 
the fact of interpenetration of consciousness and the will; the control of 
consciousness over the spontaneous emotive dynamism conditioning the exercise of 
the free will - the proper function of the will - is simultaneously conditioned 
by the will.</P>
<P align=justify>The emotionalization of consciousness begins when the image of 
the meanings of the particular emotive instances and of objects they are related 
to fades in consciousness, so that feelings may outgrow their current 
understanding by man. This is practically tantamount to a breakdown of 
self-knowledge; for consciousness, without ceasing to mirror the emotive 
distances just as they come, loses its controlling, that is to say, its 
objective, attitude toward them. We know that in this case objectivation is a 
function appertaining to self-knowledge. The objective attitude of consciousness 
toward feelings and emotions occurring in man and toward objects they are 
attached to collapses when self-knowledge stops, as it were, to objectivize. It 
no longer establishes the meanings and so does not hold emotions in intellectual 
subjection.</P>
<P align=justify>What are the reasons? They may be different. The one most often 
suggested mentions the strength or intensity of emotions, their changeability, 
and the rapidity with which they follow one after another. But this explains 
only one side of the problem. On the other side we have to consider also the 
higher or lower efficiency of self-knowledge; like any other knowledge it has to 
comply with the laws of efficiency, so that its ability to cope with its proper 
object may vary. (The reference here is to objective material, which for 
self-knowledge consists of all the facts related to the ego, and such are of 
course emotive facts.) Let us stress once again that we are not speaking of the 
effective "control" of emotions as such, which is the task of the will (and of 
the relevant moral virtues of the Aristotelian conception) but only of that 
specific control of feelings which is the task of self-knowledge and 
consciousness. (An attempt at explaining the relationship between feelings and 
emotions is deferred to a later chapter, which deals with problems of 
emotiveness.)</P>
<P align=justify>The task of self-knowledge in this respect is essential, and 
that is why its efficiency is so important. It seems that consciousness itself 
is not subject to the laws of efficiency. We do not see it as being either less 
or more efficient, though it may be less developed and mature, or more so. The 
efficiency side of consciousness seems to be wholly taken over by 
self-knowledge. Indeed, the task of self-knowledge is to prevent the 
emotionalization of consciousness from going too far, to protect consciousness 
from being deprived of its objectivizing relation to the totality of emotive 
occurrences. Feelings in the subject that is man come as if in waves. Sometimes 
they swell - they come in whole sequences, or, what is more important, are 
enhanced. But every man has in him as an objective psychical component a 
specifically emotive dynamism, which expresses itself in the intensity of the 
particular feelings, of sets of feelings, or of their resultants. (We may 
perhaps also speak of resultants of various emotional experiences in man.)</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Emotionalization and the Twofold Function of Consciousness: 
Mirroring and Experience</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The normal, indeed, the correct functioning of consciousness 
requires emotions at a certain level of intensity, albeit when this level - like 
a threshold - is exceeded, and the over-emotionalization of consciousness 
begins. If feelings are either too many or too strong, or if the efficiency of 
self-knowledge is too low, then self-knowledge is incapable of objectifying, 
that is to say, of intellectually identifying them. In this way the 
significative aspect of occurrences having an emotive character is, as it were, 
lost. At first consciousness still mirrors them as "something that happens in 
me," but when their intensity is further enhanced or self-knowledge becomes for 
the time less effective, consciousness still mirrors the occurrences as 
"something that happens," though now it is as if they had lost their relation to 
the ego. The core itself of consciousness - the ego - is then rushed to the 
background while the enhanced feelings behave as if they are uprooted from the 
soil in which their unity as well as the multiplicity and separate identity of 
their meanings develop. For it is self-knowledge that in the normal course of 
events objectivizes both this unity within the ego and the separate identity of 
the meanings of the particular emotions. Nevertheless, when 
over-emotionalization, especially in its extreme forms, gains ascendency, 
emotions are taking over directly the field of actual consciousness, which still 
continues to mirror them; but now their reflection is devoid of the element of 
objectivation or comprehension, because this is no longer provided by 
self-knowledge. Man is then aware of his emotions, but he does not control them 
any more.</P>
<P align=justify>Emotionalization in the sphere of the mirroring function of 
consciousness is accompanied by an emotionalization of experience. The assertion 
here made is that consciousness does not cease to mirror even in a state of the 
utmost intensity of emotions and feelings, and even then we still can discern 
its mirroring; now, however, this function no longer has its proper significance 
for the formation of experiences had in the emotional sphere of the whole inner 
life of man. Thus the reflexive function of consciousness, which is responsible 
for the formation of experience, loses its decisive role. It is remarkable that 
emotions and passions are not experienced by the human being when too strong; 
they are then only "undergone" by him or, strictly speaking, allowed to grow in 
him and prevail upon him in some primitive and, as it were, impersonal fashion; 
for "personal" signifies only that experience in which also the experienced 
subjectiveness of the ego is to be discerned. This being so, emotive instances 
in the form of passions, though they have their own primitive subjectivity, do 
not help to experience subjectiveness in a way that brings into prominence the 
personal ego as the source of experiences, as the center governing emotions. All 
this, however, is connected with the reflexive influence of consciousness. This 
influence is often hindered by impulsions of invading feelings, in the face of 
which the reflexive function of consciousness is, so to say, inhibited. Man then 
only experiences his emotions and allows them to dwell in him according to their 
own primitive forms of subjectivity, but does not experience them subjectively 
in a way that would bring out the personal ego as the true pivot of 
experience.</P>
<P align=justify>We now see the full complexity of the emotionalization of 
consciousness which presents throughout a particular and thus unique problem. 
Sometimes even the most powerful emotions may fail to over-emotionalize 
consciousness in the sense here considered, so that emotions remain under the 
control of consciousness. Sometimes, on the contrary, emotionalization of 
consciousness is stimulated by emotions that are (objectively considered) still 
relatively weak. But we do not intend to analyze these things here; what we are 
now interested in is - as we tried to show in the preceding section - the 
essence itself of the problem, especially from the point of view of 
consciousness, and that co-constituting of the personal subjectiveness of the 
human ego in which consciousness takes part. The emotional threshold mentioned 
earlier seems to be the necessary condition in the truly human, personal 
experiencing of emotions and, in this sense, also emotional experiences. As long 
as the intensity of feelings remains at a certain level, consciousness performs 
normally its mirroring and reflexive functions. It is only then that the genuine 
emotional experiences, with all their subjective completeness, are formed - 
instead of the primitive emotive occurrences, which, though they indubitably 
proceed from the subject, cannot be endued by consciousness with the subjective 
profile appertaining to the personal ego. This is so because the 
emotionalization of consciousness obstructs or even prevents its proper 
actualization.</P>
<P align=justify>In all that was said above no final pronouncements about the 
value of feelings and emotions for the inner life of man and for morality should 
be seen. The discussion of these questions is deferred to another chapter.</P>

<P align=center>6. SUBJECTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVISM</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Subjectivity Inherent in the Reality of the Acting 
Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The preceding analyses have brought us to the point when it 
becomes possible, and even in a way necessary, to discriminate clearly between 
man's "subjectivity" - which we are here considering together with the analysis 
of consciousness - and "subjectivism" as a mental attitude. To have shown the 
subjectivity of the human person is fundamental for the realistic position of 
this study. Indeed, man has appeared in our analysis as the subject, and it is 
he as the subject that is experiencing himself. That is the ground on which the 
dynamic relation, or rather interrelation, between the person and the action is 
actualized. The failure to recognize man's subjectivity would deprive us of the 
level on which can be grasped all the aspects of this interrelation. The aspect 
of consciousness has an essential significance for asserting man's subjectivity, 
because it is consciousness that allows man to experience himself as the 
subject. He experiences himself as such and therefore he "is" the subject in the 
strictly experiential sense. Here the understanding springs directly from the 
experience without any intermediate steps, without any recourse to arguments. He 
also experiences his actions as acts of which he himself is the agent. This 
efficacy, which we shall discuss fully in the next chapter, is made evident by 
experience and is seen by us from the aspect of consciousness. Thus, in order to 
grasp efficacy as a fully experiential datum, it is necessary to come close to 
experience as well as to man's subjectivity, which is the proper ground of 
experience. Viewing subjectivity solely from the metaphysical standpoint, and 
stating that man as a type of being constitutes the true subject of existing and 
acting, autonomous individual being, we abstract, to a large extent from what is 
the source of our visualizations, the source of experience. It is far better, 
therefore, to try to coordinate and join together the two aspects, the aspect of 
being (man, person) with the aspect of consciousness; the aspect of acts (acting 
and action) with the aspect of experience.</P>
<P align=justify>This is important not only for methodological reasons, which 
were already discussed in the introduction, but also for the sake of our subject 
matter. We made this point a moment ago when asserting that without outlining a 
possibly complete explanation of man's subjectivity it would be impossible to 
grasp the full depth of the dynamic interrelation of person and action. For the 
interrelation is not only mirrored in consciousness, as if it were reflected in 
an inner mirror of man's being and acting; in addition, it is owing to 
consciousness that it obtains in its own way its final, subjective form. The 
form is that of experience, the experience of action, the experience had of the 
efficacious interrelation of person and action, and of the moral value that 
germinates in this dynamic system. All these are objective data, but data that 
hold their objectivity and reality status only and exclusively in the 
subjectivity of man. Without completely revealing this subjectivity it is also 
impossible to reach and bring to light the whole, objectively multifarious 
composition of those factual data. It is important to stress, however, that the 
bias of subjectivism may also develop in connection with a narrow and one-sided 
bias of objectivism.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Difference between Subjectivity and 
Subjectivism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Subjectivism, as here considered, seems to consist first, in a 
complete separation of experience from action and second, in reducing to the 
mere status of consciousness and moral values that, as we have figuratively put 
it, germinate in this action as well as in the person. What we are speaking of 
now was previously seen as the "absolutization" of a single aspect. The 
reduction which operates such absolutization of the experiential aspect is 
characteristic of the specific mental attitude inherent in subjectivism and, in 
a more distant perspective, in idealism. Indubitably, consciousness is that 
aspect of man which lends itself to being absolutized: but then it ceases being 
merely an aspect of the human functioning. As long as consciousness is 
maintained as merely an aspect - and throughout this chapter we have tried to 
treat it as such - it serves only to gain a better understanding of the 
subjectivity of man, in particular of his inner relation to his own actions. 
However, when consciousness is absolutized, it at once ceases to account for the 
subjectivity of man, that is to say, his being the subject, or for his actions; 
and it becomes a substitute for the subject. Subjectivism conceives 
consciousness itself as a total and exclusive subject - the subject of 
experiences and values, so far as the domain of moral experience is concerned. 
Unfortunately, with this approach, experiences and values lose their status of 
reality; they cease being anything real and remain only as the moment of 
consciousness: <I>esse = percipL<SUP>25 </I></SUP>Ultimately consciousness 
itself ceases being anything real: it becomes but the subject of a meaningful 
network. The path of subjectivism ends in idealism.</P>
<P align=justify>We may even say that this trend has some support in the purely 
conscious character of the "acts of consciousness." It was asserted earlier that 
acts of consciousness as such and consciousness as wholly contained in them are 
neutral or indifferent to external real things and beings, as well as to the ego 
conceived as a nucleus of man seen as a real being. They do not establish 
anything - in the sense of positing its actual existence; rather, they only 
mirror things. They contain only subject matter which owes its objectiveness and 
its status of reality to self-knowledge. The boundary of objectivism and realism 
in the conception of man - in our case this applies to the person-action 
totality - is marked out by the assertion of self-knowledge. In spite of its 
specifically conscious character, consciousness integrated by self-knowledge 
into the whole of a real person retains its objective significance and thus also 
the objective status in the subjective structure of man. In this perspective and 
due to this status consciousness appears but the key to the subjectivity of man, 
and so it in no way can serve as the basis for subjectivism. It owes its role in 
human subjectivity to its being the condition of experience, in which the human 
ego reveals itself (experientially) as the object.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Conclusions Leading to the Analysis of Human 
Efficacy</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Now that we have examined the aspects of consciousness in the 
acting person we are ready for the next step, and we can embark upon an analysis 
of efficacy. We must retain, however, all the significant conclusions reached so 
far as a contribution to our further investigations into the dynamism proper to 
the human person. This dynamism, and in particular the efficacy, which forms an 
essential moment in the dynamic emergence of action from the person, is not only 
realized in the field of consciousness but is, as we have tried to show here, 
also thoroughly pervaded by consciousness. Even if in the course of our 
discussion we placed the aspect of consciousness somewhat apart and in isolation 
- like the mathematician who puts an expression outside the brackets - the 
effect aimed at was to show up more sharply the presence of consciousness in the 
person's action. Moreover, we could see better the specific function performed 
by consciousness in the formation of the characteristic subjectivity of the 
person - the subjectivity from which, because of its virtual efficacy, the 
action issues.</P>
<P align=justify>The features of human efficacy differ from those of 
consciousness, though obviously the specificity of the former cannot be grasped 
in isolation from the latter. Each of them in its own specific manner determines 
both person and action.</P></FONT>
