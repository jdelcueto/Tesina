<P align=center>CHAPTER SEVEN</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>INTERSUBJECTIVITY BY PARTICIPATION</P></b>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>I. <B>INTRODUCTION TO THE CONCEPT OF 
PARTICIPATION<SUP>75</P></SUP>
<P>&nbsp;</P></b>
<P align=justify>We cannot conclude our investigation of the acting person 
without considering, even if only in a cursory way, the issue of 
intersubjectivity.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Man's Acting "Together with Others"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The starting point for our discussions was the conviction that 
action marks a special moment in the manifestation of the person; and in the 
course of our study we have unraveled the various aspects of the person's 
dynamism in the action. Action has been indeed the road which led us to an 
understanding of the person and has simultaneously allowed us to grasp its own 
nature; for action not only carries the means, and a special basis, of the 
intuition of the person, but it also discloses its own self with every step that 
brings us nearer the person. On this road we have relied throughout on a strict 
correlation of the disclosure of the person and that of action, within one and 
the same pattern of which the person and his action are two poles; each strictly 
corresponds to the other; each displays and explains the other from its point of 
view. This correlation envisaged in its dynamic unfolding gradually reveals the 
main lines for the interpretation of the acting person.</P>
<P align=justify>The present chapter, the last in this study, adds one more 
element to the previously constructed and outlined whole. This new element, 
though actually contained in all the previous ones, has not received the 
attention it deserves and must be examined more thoroughly. We will now 
investigate that aspect of the dynamic correlation of the action with the person 
which issues from the fact that actions can be performed by human individuals 
together with others. The expression "together with others" lacks the necessary 
precision and does not describe sufficiently the reality it refers to, but for 
the moment it seems the most appropriate inasmuch as it draws attention to the 
diverse communal or social relations in which, in most cases, human actions are 
involved. This of course is a direct and natural consequence of the fact that 
man lives "together with other men," and indeed we may even go so far as to say 
that he exists together with other men. The mark of the communal - or social - 
trait is essentially imprinted on human existence itself.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Understanding "Cooperation" Requires an Understanding of Human 
Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The fact that man lives and exists together with others, as 
well as the effect this has on his manifesting himself in acting, on the action 
as such, relates to that reality we usually refer to as "society" or 
"community." Nevertheless, our purpose here is not to investigate the nature of 
society; and we do not intend to insist upon the assertion that human actions 
have a social significance, because this would lead our discussion to a totally 
new level and away from the level on which both our subject matter and our 
methods have been situated so far. On the contrary, our intention is to keep to 
our initial approach and to confine ourselves to the acting person as the first 
aim and the pivot of our investigations. In this chapter we wish merely to 
consider that aspect in the dynamic correlation of the action with the person 
which comes as a consequence of the fact that man lives and acts together with 
other men. This fact could also be defined as "cooperation," and yet between the 
two expressions there is a clear semantic difference: "to cooperate" is not the 
same thing as "to act together with others." For the time being we may as well 
use the latter expression, which appears to be more amenable to further 
differentiations and any subsequent, more precise definitions that may prove to 
be necessary in this connection.</P>
<P align=justify>We know human actions are performed in various interhuman 
relations and also in various social relations. When we say they are performed 
"together with others," we have all these different relations in mind without 
going into the details of any particular one. Together they form part of that 
aspect of the action and of the dynamic correlation of action with the person 
which we have not yet considered. The omission was not due to the inner logic of 
the problem as a whole; it appears natural that only a thorough understanding of 
the nature of man's acting can lead to a correct interpretation of cooperation, 
and not the other way round. The dynamic correlation of the action with the 
person is in itself a fundamental human reality and it remains such also in any 
actions performed together with others. In point of fact, only on the basis of 
this fundamental relation can any fact of acting together with other people 
assume its appropriate <I>human significance. </I>Such is the basic sequence, 
which cannot be reversed or neglected, and it is this sequence we shall follow 
in our inquiries.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Participatory Aspect in the Person's Acting "Together with 
Others"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is only natural that the fact of acting together with other 
people and the many different relations and reference systems it involves will 
raise new problems in our discussion. We well know how extensive and how rich is 
the realm of, for instance, sociology, which by its investigations of the nature 
and types of societies and social life indirectly shows man as a member of 
various social groups or communities that in turn influence his acting. But let 
us stress once again that we are not interested at present in the problems of 
acting from the point of view of all its complex and extensive sociological 
implications; in particular we will not consider its specifically sociological 
significance. Since the acting person is the focal point of our study, it would 
require a shift in our argument to a totally new level. This is further 
justified by the fact that the dynamic correlation of the notion of "action" 
with that of "person" is also the basic and fundamental reality in all the 
multifarious actings that have a social, communal, or interhuman character. 
Actions, which man performs in all his different social involvements and as a 
member of different social groups or communities, are essentially the actions of 
the person. Their social or communal nature is rooted in the nature of the 
person and not vice versa. And yet, to grasp the personal nature of human 
actions it is absolutely necessary to consider the consequences of the fact that 
they may be performed "together with others." The question emerges: How does 
this fact affect the dynamic correlation itself of the action with the person? 
This question is the more pressing if we emphasize that acting "together with 
others" is not only frequent and usual, but indeed of universal occurrence.</P>
<P align=justify>The answer we are seeking will emerge gradually from the series 
of discussions in this chapter entitled "Intersubjectivity by Participation." As 
we have insisted upon above, participation seems to be one of the basic channels 
of the dynamic correlation of the action with the person whenever acting is 
performed "together with others." An explanation of this statement, however, has 
to be reached step by step.</P>
<P align=center>2. <B>THE PERSONALISTIC VALUE OF ACTION</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Performance of the Action Is a 
Value<SUP>76</P></b></I></SUP>
<P align=justify>Before we continue our investigations we must look back at the 
whole of the previous analysis to see the strictly personal content of the 
action. We will then notice that the performance itself of an action by the 
person is a fundamental value, which we may call the <I>personalis tic </I>- 
personalistic or personal - value of the action. Such a value differs from all 
moral values, which <I>belong </I>to the nature of the performed action and 
issue from their reference to a norm. The personalistic value, on the other 
hand, inheres in the performance itself of the action by the person, in the very 
fact that man acts in a manner appropriate to him, that self-determination thus 
authentically inheres in the nature of his acting and the transcendence of the 
person is realized through his acting. This, as we have shown, leads to 
integration in both the somatic and the psychical sphere of man. The 
personalistic value, which inheres essentially in the performance itself of the 
action by the person, comprises a number of values that belong to the profile 
either of "transcendence" or of "integration," because they all, in their own 
way, determine the performance of the action. Thus, for instance, every 
synthesis of action and motion introduces a specific value that differs from 
that constituted by the synthesis of action and emotion, though the one and the 
other inhere in the dynamic whole of the performance of the action. Each in its 
own way conditions and brings about man's self-determination.</P>
<P align=justify>The "personalistic" value of the human action - that is, the 
personal value - is a special and probably the most fundamental manifestation of 
the <I>worth </I>of the person himself. (Since this study is primarily concerned 
with the ontology of the person there is no place in it for considering 
axiology. Even this approach, however, may give some insight into the axiology 
of the person so far as a definition both of the value of the person as such and 
of the different values within the person and the hierarchy of their mutual 
relations is concerned.) Although being is prior to action, and thus the person 
and his value is prior to and more fundamental than the value of the action, it 
is in actions that the person manifests himself - a fact we have been stressing 
from the first. The "personalistic" value of an action, strictly related to the 
<I>performing </I>of the action by the person, is therefore a special source, 
and the basis of knowledge about the value of the person (as well as about the 
values inherent in the person), according to their appropriate hierarchy. 
Essentially the correlation of the action with the person is valid also in the 
sphere of axiology, similarly as in the sphere of the ontology of the 
person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The "Personalistic" Value of the Action Conditions Its 
"Ethical" Value</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The personalistic value of an action is essentially to be 
distinguished from the strictly "moral" values and those values of the performed 
action which spring from their reference to norms. The difference between them 
is clearly apparent; the "personalistic" value is prior to and conditions any 
ethical values. Obviously any moral value, whether good or bad, presupposes the 
performance of the action, indeed full-fledged performance. If action fails to 
be actually performed or if it betrays in some respects the authenticity of 
self-determination, then its moral value loses its foundations or at any rate 
partly loses them. Hence any judgment about moral values, about any merits or 
demerits attributed to man, have to begin by determining <I>efficacy, 
self-determination, </I>and <I>responsibility; </I>in other words, we have first 
to establish whether this particular man-person <I>did </I>or <I>did not 
</I>perform the action. It is this precondition that all the discussions and 
differentiations concerning the will and its functions referred to in the 
traditional approach.</P>
<P align=justify>And yet the performance of the action by the person should not 
be seen as having a purely ontological significance; on the contrary, we should 
attribute to it also an axiological significance, since, as we have proposed 
above, the performance itself of the action by the person is a value. If we call 
this value "personalistic" it is because the person performing the action 
<I>also fulfills himself in it, </I>that is, acquires a personal feature. In 
reverse, "moral evil" may be regarded as the opposite of fulfillment; indeed, it 
is a nonfulfillment of the self in acting. When the person actualizes himself in 
the action, his appropriate structure of self-governance and self-possession is 
manifested. It is in this actualization, which we have defined as the 
"performance of the action," that ethical value is rooted; it emerges and 
develops on the "substratum" of the personalistic value, which it permeates but 
as we have already noted, is not to be identified with it.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of "Communal Action" to the Personalistic Value of 
Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have been moving, so far, on the borderline of personalistic 
and ethical values, and from time to time we have even, though only indirectly, 
moved from the first to the second. Nevertheless, the proper terrain for our 
investigations remains the personalistic value alone. It cannot be emphasized 
enough that it is the role of this value to allow us, in fact, to estimate the 
full-fledged performance - or the defects of the performance - in human actions. 
In this connection it is perhaps worth recalling the traditional teaching on 
human actions <I>(de actibus humanis), </I>which drew a distinction between the 
"perfect" and "imperfect" volitions (the term "volition" referring to the will 
as the "power" that action depends upon). Here action and performance are 
related to the person, not denying the traditional approach but supplementing it 
in an attempt to rethink it to the end. For does not the will as a power spring 
forth from the person in his self-determination whereby the person manifests his 
appropriate nature? To reduce the content of volition to will seen as an 
autonomous power alone may to some extent impoverish the reality manifested in 
the action.</P>
<P align=justify>To disclose the dynamic correlation of action-person and to 
explain it will take us along the shortest and the most direct road to the 
personalistic value of the action. Limiting the analysis of human acting to the 
level of the will understood as a power reduces the significance of action with 
regard to both its ontology and its axiology; it does so also with regard to 
"ethical axiology"; in this approach action appears to have a merely 
instrumental significance relatively to the whole ethical order. Moreover, the 
personalistic notion of the action through its many different aspects supplies 
convincing evidence of the authenticity of the personalistic value. This value 
is not yet, as stated above, in itself "ethical," but, springing from the 
dynamic depth of the person, reveals and confirms ethical values. It thereby 
allows us to understand them better in their strict correspondence with the 
person and with the whole "world of persons.</P>
<P align=justify>This has a fundamental significance in connection with the fact 
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, namely, that man acts together with 
other men. We there asked: What are the consequences of this fact for the 
dynamic correlation itself of the action with the person? We now have to ask 
another question that makes the first more precise: What is the significance of 
acting "together with others" for the personalistic value of the action?</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>3. A MORE DETAILED DEFINITION OF "PARTICIPATION"</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Person in the Philosophy of Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>How does man, we ask, fulfill himself when acting together with 
others in the different interhuman or social relations? How does his action then 
retain that fundamental unity with the person which we have defined as the 
"integration" or the "transcendence" of the person in the action? In what way do 
man's actions preserve within the context of acting "together with others" the 
hierarchy of values that issues from both "transcendence" and "integration"?</P>
<P align=justify>Such questions as "how" and "in what way" do not imply doubt or 
uncertainty; they only draw attention to the problems that arise when the fact 
of acting "together with others" is considered. There is no need, however, to 
dissimulate any doubts, at any rate not when their source has a methodic 
character. Indeed, doubt permeates through and through the thinking and the mind 
of contemporary man. In philosophical anthropology, on the one hand, the 
controversial positions taken probably result from the transition from the 
traditional to new points of view where attention is centered precisely on the 
person. The traditional philosophy of man, on the other hand - even in its 
conceptions of the person - tended to underline the role of nature: the nature 
of man is supposed to be rational and he is the person in virtue of the function 
of reason; but at the same time he has a "social" nature. In this respect the 
way of thinking about man has evolved not toward the rejection of the principle 
itself but rather in search of a better understanding and more comprehensive 
interpretations. Nobody seems to doubt either that the nature of man is 
"rational" or that he also has a "social nature." We have to ask, however, what 
does this mean? Our questions thus refer to the meaning of these assertions from 
the point of view of acting, that is, of the dynamic correlation of the action 
with the person.</P>
<P align=justify>Our aim is to explicate more fully the social nature of man for 
the sake of gaining more insights into the human person. With this in mind we 
must return to the starting point. At the origin of the assertion concerning the 
social nature of man there can be nothing more fundamental than the experience 
that man exists, lives, and acts together with other men - an experience that we 
also have to account for in this study. The expression "social nature" seems to 
signify primarily that reality of existing and acting "together with others" 
which is attributed to every human being in, as it were, a consequential way; 
obviously this attribute is the consequence of human reality itself and not 
inversely.</P><I>
<P align=justify>Participation as a Trait of Acting "Together with 
Others"</P></I>
<P align=justify>In this approach the questions we are discussing are by no 
means secondary; on the contrary, they are of primary importance. We have now 
reached a point at which we can provide a more precise definition of 
"participation." The term is used in its current sense, the one best known and 
most widely applied in everyday use, but it also has a philosophical meaning. In 
current usage "participation" is more or less equivalent to having a share or a 
part in something. We may speak for instance of participating or taking part in 
a meeting; we then state the fact in the most general and, so to speak, static 
way. We do not reach the core of the phenomenon of participation. The 
philosophical meaning of "participation" indicates, on the contrary, its very 
essence. In this latter sense the term has a long and eventful history as 
concerns both its philosophical and theological applications. We are here 
concerned not so much with a superficial assertion of the fact that a concrete 
man takes part together with other men in some kind of interacting, but rather 
in disclosing the basis of his role and his share in this interacting. It is in 
the structure of the person that it is to be sought.</P>
<P align=justify>The notion of "participation" as conceived in traditional 
philosophy seems to have been more connected with nature. It is the person's 
transcendence in the action when the action is being performed "together with 
others" - transcendence which manifests that the person has not become 
altogether absorbed by social interplay and thus "conditioned," but stands out 
as having retained his very own freedom of choice and direction - which is the 
basis as well as the condition of participation. It also corresponds to the 
situation we emphasize over again, namely, of the integration of the person in 
the action; as we know, the latter is a complementary aspect relative to the 
former. To be capable of participation thus indicates that man, when he acts 
together with other men, retains in this acting the personalistic value of his 
own action and at the same time shares in the realization and the results of 
communal acting. Owing to this share, man, when he acts together with others, 
retains everything that results from the communal acting and simultaneously 
brings about -<I>in this very manner - </I>the personalistic value of his own 
action.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Participation as a Trait of the Person Acting "Together with 
Others"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The stress laid on the words "in this very manner" emphasizes 
the real nature of this participation. First, the idea of "participation" is 
used here in order to reach to the very foundation of <I>acting together 
</I>with other persons, to those roots of such acting which stem from and are 
specific to the person himself. Second, everything that constitutes the 
personalistic value of the action - namely, the performance itself of an action 
and the realization of the transcendence and the integration of the person 
contained in it - is realized because of acting together with others.</P>
<P align=justify>Participation thus represents a feature of the person itself, 
that innermost and homogeneous feature which determines that the person existing 
and acting together with others does so as a person.<SUP>77 </SUP>So far as 
acting itself is concerned, participation is responsible for the fact that the 
person acting together with others performs an action and fulfills himself in 
it. We see now that participation is the factor that determines the 
personalistic value of all cooperation. The sort of cooperation - or, more 
precisely, of acting together with others - in which the element of 
participation is missing, deprives the actions of the person of their 
personalistic value. On the other hand, we know from experience that in acting 
with other people situations may arise which in different ways limit 
self-determination and thus also the personal transcendence and the integration 
of acting. Indeed, the limitation of the personalistic value may sometimes go so 
far that we can hardly speak of "acting together with others" in the sense of 
the "authentic" actions of the person. Under certain conditions "acting" (as the 
synonym of the "action") may change to denoting something that only "happens" to 
a particular man under the influence of other human beings. An extreme example 
of this is so-called "mass psychology," when a large group of men may begin to 
act in an uncontrolled way and so affect the behavior of individuals.</P><I>
<P align=justify>Participation Renders Multiform Interpersonal Relations 
Possible</P></I>
<P align=justify>All this must be taken into consideration when defining the 
notion of "participation" in its proper sense. In the diverse relations of 
acting together with others, participation presents itself as an adaptation to 
these relations and hence as a multifarious reference of the person to other 
persons. In explaining, if only in outline, the form and the content of 
participation, we must examine communal acting in its objective as well as 
subjective aspect. In addition, we must undertake some other analyses, although 
even then we shall not exhaust the essential meaning and the substance of 
"participation"; as conceived of here it not only applies to the different forms 
of the reference of the person to "others," of the individual to the society, 
but it also denotes that very foundation of these forms which inheres in and 
corresponds to the person.</P>
<P align=justify>First, participation corresponds to the person's transcendence 
and integration in the action because, as we have already emphasized, it allows 
man, when he acts together with other men, to realize thereby and at once the 
<I>authentically personalis tic value - </I>the performance of the action and 
the fulfillment of himself in the action. Acting "together with others" thus 
corresponds to the person's transcendence and integration in the action, when 
man chooses what is chosen by others or even <I>because </I>it is chosen by 
others - he then identifies the object of his choice with a value that he sees 
as in one way or another homogeneous and his own. This is connected with 
selfdetermination, for self-determination in the case of acting "together with 
others" contains and expresses participation.</P>
<P align=justify>When we say that "participation" is a distinct feature of the 
person we do not mean the person in the abstract but a concrete person in his 
dynamic correlation with the action.</P>
<P align=justify>In this correlation "participation" signifies, on the one hand, 
that ability of acting "together with others" which allows the realization of 
all that results from communal acting and simultaneously enables the one who is 
acting to realize thereby the personalistic value of his action. However, this 
ability is followed by its actualization. Thus the notion of "participation" 
includes here both that ability and its realization.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>4. INDIVIDUALISM AND ANTI-INDIVIDUALISM</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Theoretical and Normative Significance of 
Participation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The conception of "participation" that we are developing in 
this study has a theoretical significance. As stated earlier, it is required in 
our attempt to explain - on the ground of the dynamic correlation of the action 
with the person - the reality of the social nature of man. The conception is 
theoretical but it is also empirical in the sense that the theory of 
participation explains the fact of man's acting as well as his existing together 
with other men. Moreover, it is apparent that the theory has simultaneously an 
indirectly normative significance; it not only tells us how the person acting 
together with others fulfills himself in his acting, that is, how he realizes 
the personalistic value of his action, but it also points indirectly to certain 
obligations that are the consequence of the principle of participation. For if 
in acting "together with others" man can fulfill himself according to this 
principle, then, on the one hand, everyone ought to strive for that kind of 
participation which would allow him in acting together with others to realize 
the personalistic value of his own action. On the other hand, any community of 
acting, or any human cooperation, should be conducted so as to allow the person 
remaining within its orbit to realize himself through participation.</P>
<P align=justify>Such is the normative content that has emerged so far from our 
analyses. It is this content that seems to determine the normative -and not only 
the theoretical - significance of participation. This significance is instilled 
into the different systems of acting "together with others" by means of the 
personalistic value, which it strictly corresponds to and relies upon. Since the 
personalistic value of action is - as we know - the fundamental value 
conditioning both ethical values and the ethical order, the norm of conduct that 
issues from it directly must also have a fundamental significance. Such a norm 
is not, in the strict sense of the term, ethical; it is not the norm of an 
action performed because of the action's objective content, but one that belongs 
to the performance itself of the action, to its personal subjectiveness - an 
"inner" norm concerned with safeguardmg the self-determination of the person and 
so also his efficacy. We earlier discussed these matters in some detail, so that 
the boundary between the strictly ethical and the personalistic order should now 
be considered sufficiently defined and distinct.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Individualism and Totalism as the Two Limitations of 
Participation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>At the same time, however, the personalistic value so 
conditions the whole ethical order in acting and cooperation that the order is 
also determined by it. The action must be performed not because only then can it 
have an ethical value - and can that value be assigned to it - but also because 
the person has the basic and "natural" (i.e., issuing from the fact that he is a 
person) right to perform actions and to be fulfilled in them. This right of the 
person attains its full sense and import as a right with respect to acting 
"together with others." It is then that the normative significance of 
participation comes into full light and is confirmed. For it is in acting 
together with others that the performance of actions - the performance that is 
simultaneously the fulfillment of the person in action, and the performance and 
fulfillment in which the personalistic value of the action consists - can be 
limited or definitely thwarted. This may happen in two ways: first, there may be 
a lack of participation caused by the person as the subject-agent of acting; 
second, participation may become impossible for reasons external to the person 
and resulting from defects in the system according to which the entire human 
community of acting operates.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point in our analysis we encounter two systems, the 
implications of which must be considered, if only in part. One of these is 
called "individualism"; the other has received different names, more recently 
"objective totalism," though it could just as well be called 
"anti-individualism." Since a full-scale discussion of the two systems would 
lead us away from the chief objectives of this study we will consider only some 
of their implications. It is necessary to note, however, that they both have an 
axiological and indirectly an ethical significance.</P>
<P align=justify>Individualism sees in the individual the supreme and 
fundamental good, to which all interests of the community or the society have to 
be subordinated, while objective totalism relies on the opposite principle and 
unconditionally subordinates the individual to the community or the society.</P>
<P align=justify>Clearly, each of these systems has entirely different visions 
of the ultimate good and the foundation of norms. Furthermore, each system 
occurs in a wide range of variations and shades, so much so that their analysis 
would require comprehensive sociological and historical studies. For these 
reasons we must put aside the exploration of these momentous problems and even 
simplify them somewhat; we will restrict our considerations only to those 
essential trends which according to the formulations just introduced 
characterize the two systems. We shall concentrate our attention on the 
implications they may have for the main theme of our present discussion, which 
is the acting person in all the different situations that may arise in his 
acting "together with others."</P>
<P align=justify>As has been maintained so far, inherent in acting "together 
with others" is the principle of participation, which is the essential trait of 
such acting and a special source of the rights and obligations of the person. 
The person has as his specific attribute the right to perform actions and the 
obligation to fulfill himself in action. This obligation results from the 
personalistic value inherent in fulfillment.</P>
<P align=justify>Each of the two systems or trends - whether it be individualism 
or objective totalism - tends in different ways to limit participation either 
directly, as a possibility or an ability to be actualized in acting "together 
with others," or indirectly, as that feature which is of the essence of the 
person and which corresponds to his existing "together with others," his living 
in a community.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Individualism Implies a Denial of Participation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Individualism limits participation, since it isolates the 
person from others by conceiving him solely as an individual who concentrates on 
himself and on his own good; this latter is also regarded in isolation from the 
good of others and of the community. The good of the individual is then treated 
as if it were opposed or in contradiction to other individuals and their good; 
at best, this good, in essence, may be considered as involving self-preservation 
and self-defense. From the point of view of individualism, to act "together with 
others," just as to exist "together with others," is a necessity that the 
individual has to submit to, a necessity that corresponds to none of his very 
own features or positive properties; neither does the acting and existing 
together with others serve or develop any of the individual's positive and 
essential constituents. For the individual the "others" are a source of 
limitation, they may even appear to represent the opposite pole in a variety of 
conflicting interests. If a community is formed, its purpose is to protect the 
good of the individual from the "others." This in broad outline is the essence 
of individualism, the variations and different shades of which we shall not 
consider here. We should notice, however, that individualism carries with it an 
implied denial and rejection of participation in the sense we have given it 
before; from the individualistic point of view an essentially constituent human 
pr6perty that allows the person to fulfill himself in acting "together with 
others" simply does not exist.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Totalism as Reversed Individualism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The denial of participation is also implied in totalism or 
anti-individualism, which may be looked upon as "reversed individualism." The 
dominant trait of totalism may be characterized as the need to find protection 
<I>from </I>the individual, who is seen as the chief enemy of society and of the 
common good. Since totalism assumes that inherent in the individual there is 
only the striving for individual good, that any tendency toward participation or 
fulfillment in acting and living together with others is totally alien to him, 
it follows that the "common good" can be attained only by limiting the 
individual. The good thus advocated by totalism can never correspond to the 
wishes of the individual, to the good he is capable of choosing independently 
and freely according to the principles of participation; it is always a good 
that is incompatible with and a limitation upon the individual. Consequently, 
the realization of the common good frequently presupposes the use of 
coercion.</P>
<P align=justify>Again, we have presented but a summary outline of the thinking 
and proceedings characteristic of the system of anti-individualism, in which the 
principles of individualism are clearly apparent but viewed in reverse and 
applied to contrary ends. Individualism is concerned with protecting the good of 
the individual from the community; the objective of totalism, in contrast - and 
this is confirmed by numerous historical examples - is to protect a specific 
common good from the individual. Nevertheless, both tendencies, both systems of 
thinking and proceedings have at their origin the same conception of 
man.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Conception of the Human Being Underlying Both 
Systems</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The way of thinking about the human being underlying both 
systems may be defined as "impersonalistic" or "antipersonalistic," inasmuch as 
the distinctive characteristic of the personalistic approach is the conviction 
that to be a person means to be capable of participation. Obviously, if this 
conviction is to mature it has to find its concretion in reality: it has to be 
cultivated and developed. It is not only human nature that forces man to exist 
and to act together with others, but his existing and acting together with other 
human beings enables him to achieve his own development, that is, the intrinsic 
development of the person. This is why every human being must have the right to 
act, which means "freedom in the action," so that the person can fulfill himself 
in performing the action.</P>
<P align=justify>The significance of this right and this freedom is inherent in 
the belief in the personalistic value of human action. It is on account of this 
value and because of it that the human being has the right to the total freedom 
of acting. This leads to the rejection of both individualism and 
anti-individualism together with all their erroneous implications.</P>
<P align=justify>On the one hand, the total freedom of action, which results 
from its personalistic value, conditions the ethical order and simultaneously 
determines it. On the other hand, the moral order instills into humaji actions - 
in particular, those within the orbit of acting "together with others" - those 
determinants, and thus also limitations, which are the consequence of purely 
ethical values and norms. The determinants and the limitations so introduced are 
not, however, opposed to the personalistic value; for it is only in the "moral 
good" that the person can fulfill himself, inasmuch as "evil" means always a 
"nonfulfillment."</P>
<P align=justify>There can be no doubt that man has the freedom of acting; he 
has the right of action, but he has not the right to do wrong. Such is the 
general trend of the determinant, which while issuing from the rights of man 
corresponds nevertheless to the personalistic order.</P><B>
<P align=center>5. PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Participation as a Constitutive Factor of the 
Community</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We know that individualism and totalism (anti-individualism) 
grow out of the same soil. Their common root is the conception of man as an 
individual, according to which he is more or less deprived of the property of 
participation. This way of thinking is also reflected in the conceptions of 
social life, in the axiology of the society and in ethics, or, more precisely, 
in those different axiologies of the society and different social ethics which 
proceed from the same ground. It is not our intention to examine the details of 
the many varieties of individualism and anti-individualism, which have been 
widely studied. We should note, however, that in the thinking about man 
characteristic of these two tendencies there seems to be no sufficient 
foundation for any authentic human community.</P>
<P align=justify>The notion of "community" expresses the reality that we have 
been focusing upon in the present chapter, in which "acting and existing 
together with others" has been repeatedly mentioned. The human community is 
strictly related to the experience of the person, which we have been tracing 
from the first but especially at this stage of our discussions. We find in it 
the reality of participation as that essential of the person which enables him 
to exist and act "together with others" and thus to reach his own fulfillment. 
Simultaneously, participation as an essential of the person is a constitutive 
factor of any human community.</P>
<P align=justify>Because of this essential property the person and the community 
may be said to coalesce together; contrary to the implications manifest in the 
individualistic and anti-individualistic thinking about man they are neither 
alien nor mutually opposed to each other.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Community Is Not the Subject in Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In order to grasp more precisely the meaning of "participation" 
- and this is now our chief aim - we have to look at it from the point of view 
of the community. Actually, such has been our standpoint from the first, and it 
is the reason why we have so often used the expression "together with others" in 
our analyses of the action and the being of the person. The notion of 
"community" is correlated with this expression while simultaneously it 
introduces a new plane of action or a new "subjectiveness" in the acting. 
Indeed, as long as we are speaking of acting or being "together with others" the 
man-person remains the manifest subject of the acting and being, but once we 
begin to speak of the <I>community, </I>then what so far has been contained in 
an adverbial sentence, can now be expressed in substantival and abstract 
terms.</P>
<P align=justify>However, we should now speak of a "quasi-subjectiveness," 
rather than of a proper subject of acting. All the people existing and acting 
together are obviously exercising a role in a common action but in a different 
way than when each of them performs an action in its entirety. The new 
subjectiveness is the share of all the members of a community, or, in a broader 
sense, of a social group. In fact, it is but a quasi-subjectiveness, because 
even when the being and acting is realized together with others it is the 
<I>man-person who is always its proper subject. </I>The human individuals 
constitute, each of them, the basic order of action. The term "community," like 
"society" or ''social group,'' indicates an order derived from the first one. 
Being and acting "together with others" does not constitute a new subject of 
acting but only introduces new relations among the persons who are the real and 
actual subjects of acting. In all discussions about the community this comment 
is necessary to avoid misunderstanding. The concept "community," also in its 
substantival and abstract sense, seems to come very near to the dynamic reality 
of the person and participation, perhaps even nearer than such notions as 
"society" or "social group."</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Associational Relationship and Community Membership</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>To analyze the notion of "community" we may and must consider 
as many - almost indefinitely numerous - facts as in the analysis of the acting 
person, a point already stressed in the introductory chapter of this study. 
Moreover, in either case it is necessary to apply methodologically analogical 
procedures. These remarks confirm once again the need to adhere to the same 
approach that we adopted at the start of these investigations. It is on this 
level of investigation that we shall have to analyze the relation existing 
between participation and community membership.</P>
<P align=justify>Within the community we find the human being, with all his 
dynamism, as one of its members. There are different terms and expressions to 
denote this membership, suited to the different kinds of relationships within 
the community or group. Thus "kinship" tells us of membership in a family group, 
a "compatriot" is one who belongs to a national group, and a "citizen" is a 
member of a still broader society represented by the state. These are only 
examples, for innumerable other social groups or communities have associated 
according to different principles, such as religious and other affiliations. In 
each of these examples man's associational relationship is differently 
constituted.</P>
<P align=justify>Sociologists quite rightly point to the semantic difference 
between the terms "society" and "community": "society" objectivizes the 
community or a number of mutually complementary communities. Since in this study 
our objective is to <I>disclose the bases or foundations of things, </I>we are 
primarily concerned with community membership rather than with the associational 
relationship of the society. The examples noted above tell of membership in 
different kinds of communities; they not only indicate the principle of 
membership in a community but also the different bonds and relations that exist 
between men and women belonging to these communities. For instance, words such 
as <I>brother </I>and <I>sister </I>stress the family bonds rather than that 
membership in a family group denoted by the term <I>kinship.</P></I>
<P align=justify>In the rich resources of language there are countless words 
that stress - like all the terms in the previous examples - the fact of the 
community itself, the communal existence of human beings and the bonds that are 
formed among them on account of their communal existence. There are, however, 
other words that denote first of all the community of acting rather than the 
communal existence, the community of being. For instance, when speaking of an 
apprentice, an assistant, or a foreman, we imply that there is a team or group 
working together; the stress is then on the community of acting and the bonds 
thus formed, while communal existence, the community of being, is implied only 
indirectly.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Associational Relationship Differs from 
Participation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the preceding section we saw that man can be a member of 
different communities, all of which are the product of man existing or acting 
together with other men. At present we are mainly interested in the "community 
of acting" because of its closer relation to the dynamic action-person 
correlation as a basis and a source of cognition. Nevertheless, the "community 
of being" always conditions the "community of acting," and so the latter cannot 
be considered apart from the former. The crux of the problem lies, however, in 
that <I>membership in any of these communities is not to be identified with 
participation. </I>This is perhaps best illustrated by the following example. A 
team of laborers digging a trench or a group of students attending a lecture are 
communities of acting; each laborer or student is a member of a definite 
community of acting. These communities may also be considered from the point of 
view of the aim that its members are collectively striving for. In the first 
case, the aim is the trench, which in turn may serve other aims, such as laying 
foundations for a construction. In the other, the aim is to learn about the 
problems that are the theme of the lecture, which in turn forms part of a course 
of studies and thus of the students' curriculum. We also see that all the 
diggers and all the students have a common goal. This objective unity of goals 
helps to objectivize the community of acting itself. Hence, in the objective 
sense, a "community of acting" may be defined according to the aim that brings 
men to act together; each of them is then a member of an objective 
community.</P>
<P align=justify>From the point of view of the person and the action, however, 
it is not only the objective community of acting but also its subjective moment, 
which we have here called "participation," that is importanf. The question is 
whether a man belonging to a community of acting, like those mentioned in our 
examples, is in a position in his communal acting to perform real actions and 
fulfill himself in them; the possibility of this performance and the fulfillment 
it brings about are determined by participation. Nevertheless, even when acting 
"together with others" man can remain outside the community that is constituted 
by participation.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point we are faced with a problem that can never be 
resolved without at least a cursory look at the question of the so-called 
"common good." We already know that the moment of participation inheres among 
others in choice; man chooses what others choose and indeed often because others 
choose it, but even then he chooses it as his own good and as the end of his own 
striving. What he thus chooses is his own good in the sense that he as the 
person can fulfill himself in it. It is participation that enables him to make 
these choices and to undertake this way of acting "together with others." 
Perhaps it is only then that such acting deserves to be called "cooperation," 
inasmuch as acting "together with others" does not by itself necessarily result 
in cooperation (just as it does not necessarily initiate the moment of 
participation). Within the sphere of acting, just as within the sphere of 
existing, a community may remain at the objective level and never pass to the 
subjective level.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=center>6. </I><B>PARTICIPATION AND THE COMMON GOOD</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Common Good and the Problem of Community and 
Participation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We now see that the solution to the problem of the community 
and participation lies not in the reality itself of acting and existing 
"together with others," but is to be looked for in the common good, or, more 
precisely, in the meaning we give to the notion of the "common good." If the 
meaning of "common good" is for us the same as that of the "good of the 
community," then we understand it correctly though we run a serious risk of 
one-sidedness. This onesidedness threatens in the domain of axiology and is 
similar to that suggested in anthropology by the conceptions of individualism 
and anti-individualism. The common good is obviously the good of the community - 
or, to go even further in the direction of objectivation, the good of the 
society - but it has still to be clearly defined in the light of the foregoing 
considerations.<SUP>78</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Evidently, the very fact that people act together is sufficient 
to ascertain the existence of an objective community of acting, as for instance 
in the cases of the team of laborers digging a trench or of the group of 
students attending a lecture. In this context the common good as the good of a 
definite community of acting - and this is always connected with a community of 
being - may be easily identified with the goal of the community. Thus for the 
laborers the common good may appear to be solely the completion of the 
excavation, and for the students the commitment to memory of the information 
contained in the lecture.</P>
<P align=justify>These common goods, however, may also be considered as links in 
a teleological chain, in which case every one of them is seen as a means to 
attain another goal that now presents itself as the common good; thus the 
excavation dug out by the laborers will serve to lay the foundations for a 
future construction, and the attended lecture is but a link in a long and 
complex process of learning with examinations as a formal test of the knowledge 
acquired in that particular field.</P><B><I>
<P>Teleological and Personalistic Conceptions of the Common Good</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>To identify the common good, however, with the goal of common 
acting by a group of people is manifestly a cursory and superficial 
simplification. The preceding examples lead to the conclusion that the <I>goal 
</I>of common acting, when understood in a purely objective and "material" way, 
though it includes some elements of the common good and has reference to it, can 
never fully and completely constitute it.</P>
<P align=justify>This assertion becomes obvious in the light of our previous 
analyses. It is impossible to define the common good without simultaneously 
taking into account the subjective moment, that is, the moment of acting in 
relation to the acting persons. When we consider this moment we see that the 
common good does not consist solely in the goal of the common acting performed 
by a community or group; indeed, it also, or even primarily, consists in that 
which conditions and somehow initiates in the persons acting together their 
participation, and thereby develops and shapes in them a subjective community of 
acting.</P>
<P align=justify>We can conceive of the common good as being the goal of acting 
only in that double - subjective <I>and </I>objective - sense. Its subjective 
sense is strictly related to participation as a property of the acting person; 
it is in this sense that it is possible to say that the common good corresponds 
to the social nature of man.</P>
<P align=justify>In our investigations we have tended to avoid going into the 
details of that extensive and momentous domain of axiology and ethics which is 
associated with the notion of the "common good" and determines its full 
significance. We have concentrated on the common good primarily as the principle 
of correct participation, which allows the person acting together with other 
persons to perform authentic actions and to fulfill himself through these 
actions. Our concern is therefore with the <I>genuinely personalistic structure 
of human existence in a community, </I>that is, in every community that man 
belongs to.</P>
<P align=justify>The common good becomes the good of the community inasmuch as 
it creates in the axiological sense the conditions for the common existence, 
which is then followed by acting. If we can say that in the axiological order 
the community, the social group, or the society are established by the common 
good, then we can define each of them according to its appropriate common good. 
Acting is then considered jointly with being, with existing.</P>
<P align=justify>The common good, however, belongs primarily to the sphere of 
being "together with others," while the acting together with others is 
insufficient to disclose the whole reality of the common good, though it also 
plays its role in this respect. Even groups that are brought together mainly by 
their common acting rather than by any social bonds - for instance, a group of 
laborers excavating a trench or of students together attending a lecture - not 
only strive through their acting together to attain their goal but also manifest 
in different ways the appropriate modes of participation of the individual 
members of a community of acting.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Common Good as the Foundation of Authentic Human 
Communities</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In groups established on the principle of a temporary community 
'of acting, participation is neither manifested as clearly, nor realized to the 
same extent, as in communities where their stability is grounded in the fact of 
being together - for instance, a family, a national group, a religious 
community, or the citizens of a state. The axiology of these latter communities, 
which is expressed in the common good, is much deeper. Consequently the 
foundations of participation are much stronger, while the need of participation 
is much more acute.</P>
<P align=justify>In such communities of being - they have earned the name of 
natural societies because they inherently correspond to the social nature of man 
- each of its members expects to be allowed to choose what others choose and 
because they choose, and that his choice will be his own good that serves the 
fulfillment of his own person. At the same time, owing to the same ability of 
participation, man expects that in communities founded on the common good his 
own actions will serve the community and help to maintain and enrich it.</P>
<P align=justify>Under conditions established according to this axiological 
pattern he will readily relinquish his individual good and sacrifice it to the 
welfare of the community. Since such a sacrifice corresponds to the ability of 
participation inherent in man, and because this ability allows him to fulfill 
himself, it is not "contrary to nature."</P>
<P align=justify>Thus the priority of the common good, its superiority over the 
partial or individual goods, does not result solely from the quantitative aspect 
of the society; it does not follow from the fact that the common good concerns a 
great number or the majority while the individual good concerns only individuals 
or a minority. It is not the numbers or even the generality in the quantitative 
sense but the intrinsic character that determines the proper nature of the 
common good. This treatment of the problem is a continuation of our criticism of 
individualism and anti-individualism; it follows from our earlier discussion of 
participation and serves as a further c6nfirmation of the conclusions then 
reached. We can see how from the reality constituted by "common acting" and 
"common being," participation emerges as a dynamic factor of the person and the 
action and also as the basis of every authentic human community.</P><B>
<P align=center>7. "AUTHENTIC" ATTITUDES</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>A Pre-ethical Analysis</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The discussion of the proper significance of the "common good," 
that is, of the relation that ought to exist between participation as the 
essential dynamic spring of a person and the common good, leads us to consider 
some attitudes that characterize the acting and being "together with others." 
First, we must distinguish the attitudes of "solidarity" and of "opposition." We 
propose that the proper meaning of both "solidarity" and "opposition" emerges 
from the investigation of the community of acting or being and by reference to 
the common good specific for this community. To start with, the meaning of these 
terms is associated with a certain qualification of action that ultimately 
becomes an ethical qualification. In the present analysis, however, we will 
concentrate rather on the personalistic significance of each of these attitudes 
and consequently the qualification itself which we have in mind will remain at a 
pre-ethical rather than an ethical level. Our aim remains, indeed, to outline 
the structures of human acting and in this connection to underline the value of 
the <I>fulfillment </I>of an action rather than that type of value of a 
performed action which issues from its <I>relation to ethical norms. </I>Of 
course, we may from this approach pass easily to an ethical analysis, once we 
assume the very performance of an action constitutes a good, which by its 
immanent value becomes an obligation. Undoubtedly, the performance itself of the 
action is a good of the kind that imposes an obligation on the one who performs 
it as well as on others, and this latter is an essential element of social 
ethics.</P>
<P align=justify>Here we intend to continue our interest in the subjective 
performance of actions and in its immanent value so far as this value is 
personalistic. It is in these relations that we can find the key to the 
interpretation of the person's appropriate dynamism, also within the framework 
of different communities of acting and being. Thus we will investigate the 
above-mentioned attitudes, primarily in the personalistic perspective and in 
this sense pre-ethical. At the same time, however, we must keep in mind that 
here, even more than throughout this study, we are moving upon the territory of 
ontology and ethics, to which we are committed by the axiological aspect of 
action and by the wealth of values inextricably involved in the ontology of the 
person and the action.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Attitude of Solidarity</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The attitude of "solidarity" cannot be dissociated from that of 
"opposition," for each is necessary to the understanding of the other. The 
attitude of solidarity is, so to speak, the natural consequence of the fact that 
human beings live and act together; it is the attitude of a community, in which 
the common good properly conditions and initiates participation, and 
participation in turn properly serves the common good, fosters it, and furthers 
its realization. "Solidarity" means a constant readiness to accept and to 
realize one's share in the community because of one's membership within that 
particular community. In accepting the attitude of solidarity man does what he 
is supposed to do not only because of his membership in the group, but because 
he has the "benefit of the whole" in view: he does it for the "common good." The 
awareness of the common good makes him look beyond his own share; and this 
intentional reference allows him to realize essentially his own share. Indeed, 
to some extent, solidarity prevents trespass upon other people's obligations and 
duties, and seizing things belonging to others. In this sense solidarity is in 
harmony with the principle of participation, which from the objective and 
"material" point of view indicates the presence of "parts" in the communal 
structure of human acting and being. The attitude of solidarity means respect 
for all parts that are the share of every member of the community. To take over 
a part of the duties and obligations that are not mine is intrinsically contrary 
to participation and to the essence of the community.</P>
<P align=justify>Nevertheless, there are situations in social and individual 
life that make it necessary. In such a situation, to keep strictly to one's own 
share would mean, in fact, lack of solidarity. Such a possibility indicates that 
in the attitude of solidarity the reference to the common good must always 
remain alive: it must dominate to the extent that it allows one to know when it 
is necessary to take over more than one's usual share in acting and 
responsibility. That acute sense of the needs of the community which 
distinguishes the attitude of solidarity emphasizes above any particularism or 
divisions the mutual complementariness between the members of the solidaristic 
community; every member of a community has to be ready to "complement" by his 
action what is done by other members of the community. This mutual 
complementariness is in a way an intrinsic element in the very nature of 
participation, which we are now interpreting subjectively, that is, as the 
dynamic factor of the person, and not just objectivelY as the "parts" that are 
the share of every participant in the communal structure of acting and being. It 
is why we see in the attitude of solidarity an intrinsic manifestation of 
participation as a feature of the person. It is this attitude that allows man to 
find the fulfillment of himself in complementing others.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Attitude of Opposition</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>As mentioned above, the attitude of solidarity does not 
contradict the attitude of opposition; opposition is not inconsistent with 
solidarity. The one who voices his opposition to the general or particular rules 
or regulations of the community does not thereby reject his membership; he does 
not withdraw his readiness to act and to work for the common good. Different 
interpretations of opposition that an individual may adopt with respect to 
society are of course possible, but here we adopt the one that sees it as 
essentially an attitude of solidarity; far from rejecting the common good or the 
need of participation, it consists on the contrary in their confirmation. This 
opposition aims then at more adequate understanding and, to an even greater 
degree, the means employed to achieve the common good, especially from the point 
of view of the possibility of participation. We have experience of innumerably 
different types of oppositions that have been continually expressed in the 
course of man's existing and acting "together with others," which show that 
those who in this way stand up in opposition do not intend thereby to cut 
themselves off from their community. On the contrary, they seek their own place 
and a constructive role within the community; they seek for <I>that 
</I>participation and <I>that </I>attitude to the common good which would allow 
them a better, a fuller, and a more effective share of the communal life. It 
would be too easy to quote endless examples of people who contest - and thus 
adopt the attitude of opposition - because of their deep concern for the common 
good (e.g., parents may disagree with the educational system or its methods 
because their views concerning the education of their children differ from those 
of the official educational authorities).</P>
<P align=justify>It would need a thorough inquiry to show the essence of 
opposition in all its aspects, whereas we may here only indicate it. The 
attitude of opposition is relative, on the one hand, to that particular view one 
takes of the community and of what is good for it, and on the other, it 
expresses the strong need to participate in the common existing with other men 
and even more so in the common acting. There can be no doubt that this kind of 
opposition is essentially constructive; it is a condition of the correct 
structure of communities and of the correct functioning of their inner system. 
More precisely, in order for opposition to be constructive, the structure, and 
beyond it the system of communities of a given society must be such as to allow 
the opposition that emerges from the soil of solidarity not only to <I>express 
</I>itself within the framework of the given community but also to <I>operate 
</I>for its benefit. The structure of a human community is correct only if it 
admits not just the presence of a justified opposition but also that practical 
effectiveness of opposition required by the common good and the right of 
participation.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Sense of Dialogue</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We thus see that the common good has to be conceived of 
dynamically and not statically - a fact that has been noted earlier. In fact, it 
must liberate and support the attitude of solidarity but never to a degree such 
as to stifle opposition. It seems that the principle of dialogue is very aptly 
suited to that structure of human communities and participation which satisfies 
these needs. The notion of "dialogue" has different meanings, but here we are 
primarily concerned with the one that is operative in the formation and the 
strengthening of interhuman solidarity also through the attitude of opposition. 
Undoubtedly opposition may make the cooperation of men less smooth and more 
difficult, but it should never damage or prevent it. The principle of dialogue 
allows us to select and bring to light what in controversial situations is right 
and true, and helps to eliminate any partial, preconceived or subjective views 
and trends. Such views and inclinations may become the seed of strife and 
conflict between men, while what is right and true always favors the development 
of the person and enriches the community. Dialogue, in fact, without evading the 
strains, the conflicts, or the strife manifest in the life of various human 
communities takes up what is right and true in these differences, what may 
become a source of good for men. Consequently, it seems that in a constructive 
communal life the principle of dialogue has to be adopted regardless of the 
obstacles and difficulties that it may bring with it along the way.</P><B>
<P align=center>8. "NONAUTHENTIC" ATTITUDES</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Authentic and Nonauthentic Attitudes</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>All that was said so far about solidarity and opposition as 
well as our general option of the principle of dialogue (a more detailed 
justification of this option would require a separate study) has to be 
constantly verified in juxtaposition with that truth about the action and the 
person which we have been laboriously striving for throughout this book. Both 
the attitude of solidarity and that of opposition appear to be intrinsically 
"authentic." In the first place, each allows the actualization not only of 
participation but also of the transcendence of the person in the action. (We 
have submitted to comprehensive analyses this transcendence - the 
self-determination and the fulfillment of the person.) In the second place, it 
appears that in either of those attitudes transcendence may play its role. Thus 
in this sense both attitudes are authentic inasmuch as <I>each respects the 
personalistic value of the action.</P></I>
<P align=justify>Evidently, recognizing the essential role for both attitudes, 
it has to be kept in mind that in practice they have to be constantly tested as 
well in the interpretation given to specific situations as in other actual 
manifestations. Indeed, the lack of discernment may very easily distort the 
attitude of solidarity as well as that of opposition, changing either of them in 
concrete situations into nonauthentic attitudes deprived of their true 
personalistic value. The touchstone for discernment is the <I>dynamic 
subordination of action to truth </I>that is so essential for the person's 
transcendence in the action. This subordination is reflected in the <I>righteous 
conscience, </I>the ultimate judge of the authenticity of human attitudes. Also, 
the common good as recognized has to manifest itself in its relation to the 
righteous conscience, which safeguards its dynamism and the viability of 
participation.</P>
<P align=justify>Speaking of the possible loss of authenticity, which threatens 
the attitudes of solidarity and opposition, each in a different way and for 
different reasons, we have to make note of some nonauthentic attitudes, which we 
shall define here by popular rather than scientific terms. One of these 
attitudes is currently called a servile "conformism" and the other may be called 
"noninvolvement"; either may develop when man deviates from the authentic 
attitudes of solidarity and opposition by depriving them of those inherent 
elements which are the condition of participation and the personalistic value. 
The neglect of these elements may gradually change solidarity into conformism 
and the attitude of opposition into that of noninvolvement. It would, however, 
be an accidental occurrence, whereas the essential cause of the lack of 
authenticity in either of these distorted attitudes seems to be of a fundamental 
nature. It is on this assumption that we will now proceed with our 
discussion.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Conformism as a Nonauthentic Attitude</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The term "conformism" derives from "to conform" and denotes a 
tendency to comply with the accepted custom and to resemble others, a tendency 
that in itself is neutral, in many respects positive and constructive or even 
creative. This constructive and creative assimilation in the community is a 
confirmation and also a manifestation of human solidarity. But when it begins to 
sway toward servility, it becomes highly negative. It is this negative tendency 
that we call "conformism." It evidences not only an intrinsic lack of solidarity 
but simultaneously an attitude of evading opposition; in short, a 
noninvolvement. If it still denotes man's assimilation with the other members of 
a community, it does so only in an external and superficial sense, in a sense 
devoid of the personal grounds of conviction, decision, and choice. Thus 
conformism consists primarily in an attitude of compliance or resignation, in a 
specific form of passivity that makes the man-person to be but the subject of 
<I>what happens </I>instead of being the <I>actor </I>or <I>agent 
</I>responsible for building his own attitudes and his own commitment in the 
community. Man then fails to accept his share in constructing the community and 
allows himself to be carried with and by the anonymous majority.</P>
<P align=justify>Even when the servile attitude of conformism does not become an 
outright denial or limitation, it always indicates a weakness of personal 
transcendence of self-determination and choice. It is this weakness that clearly 
shows the personalistically negative significance of the attitude of conformism. 
The problem of conformism obviously does not lie solely in the submission to the 
other members of the community, all the more so as such a submission may very 
often be a positive symptom. It lies much deeper and consists in a definite 
renunciation of seeking the fulfillment of oneself in and through acting 
"together with others." We may say that the manperson complies with his own self 
being as absorbed by the community. At the same time, however, he himself 
withdraws from the community.</P>
<P align=justify>Conformism in its servile form then becomes a denial of 
participation in the proper meaning of the term. A mere semblance of 
participation, a superficial compliance with others, which lacks conviction and 
authentic engagement, is substituted for real participation. Thus the 
specifically human ability of shaping creatively his community is dwarfed, 
annihilated, or perverted. This state of things cannot but have a negative 
effect on the common good whose dynamism springs from true personal 
participation. Simultaneously, conformism favors situations marked by 
indifference toward the common good. We may then look at it as a specific form 
of individualism leading to an evasion from the community, which is seen as a 
threat to the good of the individual, accompanied by a need to dissimulate 
oneself from the community behind a mask of external appearances. Hence 
conformism brings <I>uniformity </I>rather than <I>unity. </I>Beneath the 
uniform surface, however, there lies latent differentiation, and it is the task 
of the community to provide for the necessary conditions for turning it into 
personal participation.</P>
<P align=justify>Situations of prevailing conformism can never be accepted as 
satisfactory; for when people adapt themselves to the demands of the community 
only superficially and when they do so only to gain some Immediate advantages or 
to avoid trouble, the person as well as the community incur irremediable 
losses.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Noninvolvement as a Nonauthentic Attitude</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The attitude, which we have called "noninvolvement," seems to 
be characterized by a disregard for those appearances of concern for the common 
good which also characterizes conformism. In spite of the fact that the attitude 
of conformism evades opposition, that of avoidance evades conformism. This 
latter does not thereby adopt an authentic feature of opposition, which would 
consist in both an active concern for the common good and in participation. 
Noninvolvement is nothing but a withdrawal. It may sometimes manifest a protest, 
but even then it still lacks the active concern of participation; moreover, it 
characterizes man's absence from his community. The absent, as the saying goes, 
are always in the wrong. This is very often found to be true in the case of 
noninvolvement, though sometimes the attitude is adopted in the hope that 
absence can be expressive, that it may in certain situations involve taking a 
position in an argument; noninvolvement then becomes a kind of substitute or 
compensatory attitude for those who find solidarity too difficult and who do not 
believe in the sense of opposition. Indeed, it would be impossible to deny that 
this attitude may result from a deliberate conscious decision and then its 
essentially personalistic value has to be acknowledged. But even if there are 
valid reasons to justify its being adopted by the individual these same reasons 
become an accusation of the community insofar as it has caused it. After all, if 
participation is a fundamental good of a community, when participation becomes 
impossible - as in the attitude of noninvolvement when justified by the existing 
conditions - the functioning and the life of the community must somehow be 
defective. If the members of a community see the only solution to their personal 
problems in withdrawal from the communal life, this is a sure sign that the 
common good in this community is conceived of erroneously.</P>
<P align=justify>Nevertheless, for all that may in a way justify noninvolvement 
as a kind of shrunken compensatory attitude for full-fledged fulfillment, we 
cannot consider it as authentic. At many points it borders on conformism, not to 
mention the instances when both attitudes merge into something that might 
perhaps be defined as a "conformist noninvolvement." The most important, 
however, is the fact that either attitude causes man to abandon his striving for 
fulfillment in acting "together with others"; he is convinced of being deprived 
of his prerogatives to be "himself" by the community and thus tries to save it 
in isolation. In the case of conformism he attempts to maintain appearances but 
in that of noninvolvement he no longer seems to care about them. In either case 
he has been forcibly deprived of something very important: of that dynamic 
strain of participation unique to the person from which stem actions leading to 
his authentic fulfillment in the community of being and acting together with 
others.</P><B>
<P align=center>9. FELLOW MEMBER AND NEIGHBOR</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>Two Interrelated Systems of Reference</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Thus we are led to an even deeper layer of the reality of the 
person when his existing and acting is viewed from the standpoint of his 
membership in a community "together with others." The problem of participation 
appears to have been discussed sufficiently in contemporary sociological and 
anthropological studies with respect to the fact that man belongs to various 
communities simultaneously. His membership in any one of them entails a specific 
reference system, which the differentiation of a whole range of persons 
belonging to the same community makes very complex and rich. This reference 
system of being a "member" of a group is closely related to another one that 
also plays a very important role in participation and is best designated by the 
word "neighbor." In spite of the nearness and even some mutual overlapping of 
these systems of references, they are not identical. The content of the notion 
of "neighbor" differs essentially from what is contained in the notion "member 
of a community." Each points toward different possibilities and different 
tendencies within the personal participation. Each expresses differently the 
personal and the social nature of man.</P>
<P align=justify>If <I>neighbor </I>and <I>member of a community </I>are then 
two different notions each representing different forms and different reference 
systems, it is because to be and to act "together with others" places man within 
the range of diverse relations. The terms "neighbor" and "member of a community" 
(society) may help to understand better and more precisely the idea of 
participation. Indeed, "participation" itself means something else when it 
refers to a member of a community than when it refers to a neighbor.</P>
<P align=justify>To some extent, however, the two notions concur. As a member of 
a community, man is also another man's neighbor; this brings them closer 
together and makes them, so to speak, "closer" neighbors. Hence with respect to 
the membership of the same community the circle of every man's neighbors is 
either closer or more distant to him. It is natural for us to be closer with our 
family or our compatriots than with the members of other families or other 
nations. In this system of reference closer relationships always tend to 
displace the more distant ones; but of course in interhuman relations there is 
also alienation or estrangement. The notion of neighbor has, however, a deeper 
application than closeness (as opposed to alienation) in interhuman relations, 
and it is thus more fundamental than the notion of membership in a community. 
Membership of any community presupposes the fact that men are neighbors, but it 
neither constitutes nor may abolish this fact. People are or become members of 
different communities; in these communities they either establish close 
relations or they remain strangers - the latter reflects a lack of the communal 
spirit - but they are all neighbors and never cease to be neighbors.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Interrelation of All Men in Humanness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>This brings us to the axiological moment of great significance 
at this stage of our discussion when we are concentrating on the personalistic 
value in the community of being and acting. The notion of "neighbor" forces us 
not only to recognize but also to appreciate what in man is independent of his 
membership in any community whatever; it forces us to observe and appreciate in 
him something that is far more absolute. The notion of "neighbor" is strictly 
related to man as such and to the value itself of the person regardless of any 
of his relations to one or another community or to the society at large. The 
notion takes into account man's humanness alone, that humanness which is 
concretized in every man just as much as it is in myself. It thus provides the 
broadest basis for the community, a basis that reaches deeper than estrangement; 
it unites human beings, all human beings who are even members in different human 
communities. Although membership in a community or society presupposes the 
reality that is referred to in the notion of "neighbor," it also limits and in 
some respects removes to a more distant plane or even overshadows the broader 
concept of "neighbor"; it puts into the forefront man's relation and 
subordination to a given community - while when speaking of a neighbor we 
stress, on the contrary, only the most fundamental interrelations of all men in 
their humanness. The notion of "neighbor" refers then to the broadest, commonly 
shared reality of the human being and also to the broadest foundations of 
interhuman community. Indeed, it is the community of men, of all men, the 
community formed by their very humanness that is the basis of all other 
communities. Any community detached from this fundamental community must 
unavoidably lose its specifically human character.</P>
<P align=justify>From this point of view we have to look again at the problem of 
participation and try to reach to its ultimate consequences. We have already 
investigated the significance of participation with respect to the membership of 
the man-person in different communities, the membership which reveals and 
confirms his social nature. We now see, however, that the ability to participate 
has a wider scope and extends over the whole connotation of the notion of 
"neighbor." The man-person is capable not only of partaking in the life of a 
community, to be and to act together with others; he is also capable of 
participating in the <I>very humanness of others. </I>It is in this ability to 
participate in the humanness of every human being that all types of 
participation in a community are rooted, and it is there that it receives its 
personal meaning. This is what is ultimately contained in the notion of 
"neighbor."</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Participation Consists in Sharing the Humanness of Every 
Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The notion of "neighbor" brings out at last the full 
significance of that specific reality which from the beginning of this chapter 
we have been referring to as "participation." At this point it is important to 
emphasize that in the light of our reflection, any suggestions tending to 
mutually oppose the notions of "neighbor" and "member of a community" or to 
separate them from each other appear wholly unwarranted. We mentioned earlier 
their partial concurrence and now we intend to examine it closer. The basic 
concurrence of these notions is evidenced by the societal nature of man, even 
though it is in the relation to this nature that the difference between a 
neighbor and a member of a community becomes clearly apparent. We are not to 
assume, moreover, that the system of reference denoted by the term "neighbor" is 
the basis of all interhuman relations or that "member of a community" refers to 
the basis of social relations. Such an interpretation would be superficial and 
insufficient. The two systems of reference overlap and interpenetrate not only 
in the objective order, which shows every neighbor as belonging to a community 
and every member of a community as a neighbor, but also in the subjective order 
of participation. We have presented in this respect participation as a dynamic 
enactment of the person. Enactment, which is the person's essential feature, is 
manifested in that performance of actions "together with others," in that 
cooperation and coexistence which simultaneously serves the fulfillment of the 
person. Participation is closely associated with both the community and the 
personalistic value. This is precisely why it cannot be manifested solely by 
membership in some community but through this membership must reach to the 
<I>humanness of every man. </I>Only because of the share in humanness itself, 
which is at the roots of the notion of "neighbor," does the dynamic feature of 
participation attain its personal depth as well as its universal dimension. Only 
then can we claim that participation serves not just the fulfillment of some 
individual being, but that it also serves the fulfillment of every person in the 
community, indeed, because of his membership in the community. We may say this 
participation serves the fulfillment of persons in <I>any community </I>in which 
they act and exist. The ability to share in the <I>humanness itself of every man 
is the very core of all participation and the condition of the personalistic 
value of all acting and existing "together with others."</P>

<P align=center>10. <B>THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><I>
<P align=justify>The Neighbor as the Fundamental System of Reference</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In view of the preceding remarks concerning sharing in the 
humanness of every man it seems appropriate to dedicate the last pages of this 
book to the evangelical commandment of love. Having repeatedly stressed our 
intention not to make inroads on the territory of ethics we will not pursue here 
the purely ethical content of the commandment "Thou shalt love." We will not 
analyze the entire objective content of this commandment and in particular we 
will not seek out the ethical significance of love; our aim is only to emphasize 
the confirmation it contains for our claim that the reference system centered on 
"thy neighbor" has a crucial significance in any acting and existing "together 
with others."</P>
<P align=justify>In the first place "Thou shalt love" entails the juxtaposition 
of my neighbor with my own ego: "thy neighbor as thyself." The significance of 
the system's referring to my own self, that is, everyone's self, to the 
neighbor, is thereby brought into the fullest light. It appears fundamental 
because this system underlies any other reference system existing in a human 
community by its scope, simplicity, and depth. At the same time it tells of a 
fullness of participation that is not indicated by membership in a community 
alone. The relation to the neighbor is then the ultimate point of reference for 
any system of reference resulting from the membership in a community. The former 
is essentially superior to the latter. Such is the correct hierarchy of values 
because the system of reference to the neighbor shows the mutual relation and 
subordination of all men according to the principle of their common humanness 
itself while the system of reference based on membership in a community is 
Insufficient to reveal this relation and this subordination. We may also speak 
of a sort of transcendence of being a "neighbor" with regard to being a "member 
of a community." All this is indirectly contained in the evangelical commandment 
of love.</P>
<P align=justify>Of course, nothing of what has been said here is to be 
interpreted as a depreciation of the communal human acting and being; any such 
conclusions would be entirely false. The commandment, "Thou shalt love," has 
itself a thoroughly communal character; it tells what is necessary for a 
community to be formed, but more than anything else it brings into prominence 
what is necessary for <I>a community to be truly human. </I>It also tells what 
determines the true dimension of participation. This is why the two reference 
systems - of the relationship to the neighbor and to the membership of a 
community -must be considered jointly and not separately or, indeed, in 
opposition to each other, even though their distinction is entirely justified. 
This also is contained in the evangelical commandment. If we were to take a 
different point of view, then unavoidably some mutual limitations would arise; 
as a member of a community man would limit himself as a neighbor and vice versa. 
Such limitations would be a sign of a fundamental weakness of the person, of an 
absence of that dynamic feature in the person which we have defined as 
participation, of a serious defect in the social nature of man, etc. Does not 
the social nature of man have its roots in this fundamental relation and 
consequently in the very humanness of man?</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Commandment of Love Discloses the Roots of 
Alienation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Thus from the point of view of participation we have to reject 
any limitations that either of the two systems of reference may impose on the 
other. In acting and being together with others the system of reference of being 
a neighbor and the one of being a member of a community must, in part, 
interpenetrate each other and, in part, remain mutually complementary. Should a 
separation occur between them in actual practice, it would lead to downright 
alienation. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophy has rightly interpreted 
alienation as draining or sifting man from his very own humanness, that is, as 
depriving him of the value that we have here defined as "personalistic." In the 
sphere of acting and being "together with others" this danger becomes imminent 
when participation in the community itself sets constraints and overshadows 
participation in the humanness of others, when that fundamental subordination of 
my own good to that of my fellowman which imparts the specifically human quality 
to any community of men becomes defective. It seems, in fact, that the view 
sometimes expressed according to which the danger of "dehumanization" of our 
present-day civilization lies chiefly in the system of things - man's 
relationship to nature, the system of production and distribution of material 
goods, the blind pursuit of progress, etc. - is prejudiced and misleading. 
Though this view cannot be entirely overlooked, it is equally impossible to 
accept it as the only correct interpretation of the illnesses of the present-day 
world. Moreover, we have to remember, on the one hand, that although man did not 
create nature, he is its master; on the other hand, it is man who creates the 
systems of production, forms of technical civilization, utopias of future 
progress, programs of social organization of human life, etc. Thus it is up to 
him to prevent such forms of civilization from developing that would cause a 
dehumanizing influence and ensuing alienation of the individual. Consequently 
that alienation of human beings from their fellowmen for which man himself is 
responsible, is the prime cause of any subsequent alienation resulting from the 
reference systems of the material arrangements of goods and their distribution 
in social life. The essence of this alienation appears to be revealed by the 
commandment "Thou shalt love." Man's alienation from other men stems from a 
disregard for, or a neglect of, that depth of participation which is indicated 
in the term "neighbor" and by the neglect of the interrelations and 
intersubordinations of men in their humanness expressed by this term, which 
indicates the most fundamental principle of any real 
community.<SUP>79</P></SUP><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Commandment of Love as the Rule of Being and Acting 
"Together with Others"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The reference systems of the "neighbor" and of the "member in a 
community" - let us repeat once again - overlap and interpenetrate in the 
objective order of things. They interpenetrate as attitudes taken by men and 
rooted within the same individuals. Man's social nature is expressed by both 
systems: by the fact that everybody is a member of a community - even of several 
communities at once - as well as by the fact that everybody is a neighbor; it is 
there that is contained every man's special relation to himself as a person and 
to his own ego. In the light of the hierarchy of the systems outlined here and 
of the personalistic implications of the evangelical commandment of love we must 
remember in actual-life conduct the necessity of so coordinating acting and 
being "together with others" as to protect the fundamental and privileged 
position of the "neighbor." This will afford us the best protection from the 
dangers of alienation; in order to avoid this latter our concern must be to make 
the system of reference to the neighbor the ultimate criterion in the 
development of the coexistence and cooperation of men in the communities and the 
societies that are established at different levels and according to different 
intracommunal bonds. Any human community that allows this system of reference to 
become defective condemns itself to becoming unfavorable for participation and 
throws open an unbridgeable gulf between the person and the community. It leads 
to the disintegration of the community itself. Such disintegration is not the 
result of mere indifference of man toward his fellowman; its destructive causes 
lie in the threat directed toward the person but through the person unavoidably 
extending to the whole community. How intimate is the union between the person 
and the community and what is the essential content in the assertion of the 
social nature of man seems to have become clear. But it is also in this 
perspective that the neglect of its truth seems to reveal its ominous 
aspect.</P>
<P align=justify>This ominous aspect is not, however, the most significant. The 
commandment "Thou shalt love" gives prominence first of all to the brighter 
aspects in the reality of man's existing and acting "together with others." It 
is on that brighter side that we have kept the analyses in this last chapter of 
our study, without losing the focus upon the acting person. To conclude: The 
commandment of love is also the measure of the tasks and demands that have to be 
faced by all men - all persons and all communities - if the whole good contained 
in the acting and being "together with others" is to become a reality.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>POSTSCRIPT</P></b>
<P align=justify>We have now come to the end of our inquiry concerning person 
and action, but before we definitely close this theme it seems necessary to 
comment on some ideas that may have either remained outside entirely or have 
been abandoned before they were brought to some definite conclusion. The last 
chapter introduced a new dimension of the experience "man-acts" inasmuch as we 
concentrated on the type of actions when man acts "together with others" and on 
some aspects of intersubjectivity accomplished by participation. The present 
author is well aware that his attempt is incomplete, that it remains but a 
"sketch" and not a well developed conception. Nevertheless, he thought it 
necessary to incorporate such a "sketch," if only to draw attention to the need 
of including the experience of man who acts together with others in the general 
conception of the acting person. This attempt, however, shows in turn that the 
whole conception of the acting person awaits rethinking along new lines. Whether 
such an inquiry would still deal solely with person and action or would shift to 
the community, intersubjectivity, or to personal interrelations, in which the 
acting person would reveal himself and confirm or correct our already obtained 
insights in some other new dimension, is another matter.</P>
<P align=justify>The doubt may arise, however, whether the experience of acting 
"together with others" is, in fact, the basic experience, and if not, whether 
the conception of the community and intersubjective relations should not be 
presupposed in any discussion of the acting person. And yet, this author is 
convinced that no interpretation of the community and interpersonal relations 
can be laid out correctly unless it rests on some already existing preconception 
of the acting person, indeed, on a conception that in the experience of 
"man-acts" adequately discloses the transcendence of the person in the action. 
Otherwise the interpretation may fail to bring out all that constitutes the 
person and also what intrinsically conditions as well as defines a community and 
its interrelations as a community and as an interrelation of persons. Thus from 
the point of view of method as well as of substance the correct solution seems 
to be the one that would recognize the priority of the conception of the person 
and the action, and at the same time on the basis of this conception would 
search for an adequate interpretation of the community and interpersonal 
relations with all their richness and differentiations.</P>
<P align=justify>Finally, there is still one more disturbing question that 
demands some consideration. It concerns man's "existential status," the status 
of his being or existing, the whole truth about his limitations and his ontic 
contingency. Is this truth sufficiently built into the analyses of the person 
and the action? Has man's ontic status been marked with sufficient clarity in 
these analyses? Our concern in this regard is justified if for no other reason 
than that the conception of the acting person presented here issues from the 
experience "man acts" and ought to correspond to the authentic content of this 
experience. The theme of this study has been the person who reveals himself in 
and through the action, who reveals himself through all the psychosomatic 
conditionings that are simultaneously his wealth and his specific limitation. 
This is why the person manifests not only his transcendence in the action but 
also his integration appropriate to the action; it is in the integration and not 
beyond or above it that the dynamic reality of the action is constituted. The 
person, who manifests himself through the action, so to speak, permeates and 
simultaneously encompasses the whole psychosomatic structure of his own 
subject.</P>
<P align=justify>Admittedly, the aspect of the integration of the person in the 
action does not in itself explain sufficiently the ontic status of man, but it 
does bring us nearer to grasping and understanding man's status so far as this 
is made possible by the assumptions and the methods adopted in this study. 
Already in the introduction we stated that our aim was to extract from the 
experience of the action everything that would shed some light on man as a 
person, that would help, so to speak, to visualize the person; but our aim was 
never to build a theory of the person as a being, to develop a metaphysical 
conception of man. Even so, the vision of man who manifests himself as the 
person in the way which we have tried to disclose in our analyses seems to 
confirm sufficiently that his ontic status does not exceed the limits of his 
contingency - that he is always a being.</P>
<P align=justify>Having added these two explanations the author is satisfied 
that he can now close for the time being this discussion of the acting 
person.</P></FONT>
