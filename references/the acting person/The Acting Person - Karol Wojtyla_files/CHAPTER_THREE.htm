<P align=center>CHAPTER THREE</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>THE PERSONAL STRUCTURE OF SELF-DETERMINATION</P></b>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>1. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE PERSONAL STRUCTURE OF 
SELF-DETERMINATION</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>In Self-Determination the Will Is Seen as an Essential of the 
Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>A complete description of the will cannot refer simply to the 
moment of "willing" alone, neither to the exercise nor to the experience of "I 
will," in which is contained the moment of freedom identifiable with the 
experience of "I may but I need not." Although these experiences are an 
essential element of the action - as well as of morality - the will and the 
inner freedom of man have still another experiential dimension. In it the will 
manifests itself as an essential of the person, whose ability to perform actions 
derives directly from the possession of this essential rather than from some 
inherent feature of the action performed by the person. It is even possible to 
reverse this relation and to say it is the person who manifests himself in the 
will and not that the will is manifested in or by the person. Every action 
confirms and at the same time makes more concrete the relation, in which the 
will manifests itself as a feature of the person and the person manifests 
himself as a reality with regard to his dynamism that is properly constituted by 
the will. It is this relation that we call "self-determination."</P>
<P align=justify>Self-determination is related to the becoming mentioned in the 
last section of the preceding chapter. It is that becoming of the person which 
both has its own specific nature which may be disclosed in a phenomenological 
way, and indicates its own, separate ontic identity, while in morality it stands 
out as an existential fact characteristic of man. This is why in the conclusion 
to the preceding chapter attention was drawn to morality. Self-determination, 
which is the proper dynamic basis for the development of the person, presupposes 
a special complexity in the structure of the person. Only the one who has 
possession of himself and is simultaneously his own sole and exclusive 
possession can be a person. (In a different order of things, the person as a 
creature may be seen as "belonging to God," but this relation does not eliminate 
or overshadow that inner relation of self-possession or self-ownership which is 
essential for the person. It is not without reason then that medieval 
philosophers expressed this relationship in the phrase, <I>persona est sui 
iuris.)</P><B>
<P align=justify>Self-Determination Shows the Structure of Self-Governance and 
Self-Possession as Essential to the Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Owing to the will, self-possession finds its manifestation and 
its confirmation in action. The simple experience of "I will" can never be 
correctly interpreted in the dynamic, complex whole without reference to man's 
specific complexity, which is introduced by self-possession and is proper only 
to the person. Self-determination is possible only on the ground of 
self-possession. Every authentically human "I will" is an act of 
self-determination; it is so not in abstraction and isolation from the dynamic 
personal structure but, on the contrary, as the deep-rooted content of this 
structural whole. Because "I will" is an act of self-determination at a 
particular moment it presupposes structural self-possession. For only the things 
that are man's actual possessions can be determined by him; they can be 
determined only by the one who actually possesses them. Being in the possession 
of himself man can determine himself. At the same time the will, every genuine 
"I will," reveals, confirms, and realizes the self-possession that is 
appropriate solely to the person - the fact that the person is his own 
judge.</P>
<P align=justify>Self-possession has as its consequence still another relation 
that occurs in the very structure of man as a person and is most strictly 
connected with the will. It is the relation of self-governance, which is 
indispensable for the understanding and the interpretation of 
self-determination. Self-governance may also be expressed in terms of a specific 
complex whole: the person is, on the one hand, the one who governs himself and, 
on the other, the one who is governed. "'Self-governance" is here used in a 
different sense than the "self-control" of colloquial speech: self-control is 
the power to control oneself and applies only to one of the functions of the 
dynamism appropriate to man, to one of his powers or virtues, or to a set of 
these. Self-governance, on the other hand, is something far more fundamental and 
far more strictly related to the inner personal structure of man who differs 
from all other structures and all other existents in that he is capable of 
governing himself. Thus self-governance is man's power to govern himself and not 
only to control himself.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Possession Is Presupposed in Self-Governance</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Since man's power to govern himself is his distinctive property 
it presupposes self-possession and is in a way one of its aspects or its more 
concrete manifestations. The self-governance that is found in the person is 
possible only when there is self-possession that is proper to the person. 
Self-determination is conditioned by one as well as by the other. Both are 
realized in an act of self-determination, which is constituted by every real 
human "I will." Because of self-determination every man actually governs 
himself; he actually exercises that specific power over himself which nobody 
else can exercise or execute. In virtue of this self-determinating agency man is 
encapsulated, closed within his own "reasons." This network of exclusively his 
own "reasons" for life decisions makes him incommunicable to his fellowman. The 
actual meaning of the expression incommunicable'' has an even richer content 
than that with which we are here concerned, though this is also included in it. 
Man owes his structural "inalienability" (incommunicability) to the will to the 
extent to which self-governance is realized by the will, and in acting this is 
expressed and manifested as self-determination. If this structural trait of the 
whole person were to be left out of our discussion, it would be impossible to 
understand the will correctly and to interpret it adequately.</P>
<P align=justify>Indeed, it is impossible to understand or interpret the will 
except within the personal structure. It is only in this structure that it 
operates and can manifest its true nature. In nonpersonal beings, whose dynamism 
is achieved solely at the level of nature, there are no reasons for the 
existence of the will. Self-determination, on the other hand, is specific to the 
person; it is self-determination that at the level of the person binds together 
and integrates the different manifestations of the human dynamism. It also 
constantly constitutes, defines, and brings into view this level as such. 
Because of it, in experience - primarily in self-experience - man is given as 
the person. In self-determination the will is present first of all as the 
essential of the person and only then as a power.<SUP>38 </SUP>When we consider 
this difference more fully below, its meaning will explain itself. Then also the 
relation between person and nature - as revealed by the experience of freedom 
that is contained in self-determination - will be seen more clearly.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>2. AN ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET THE INTEGRAL DYNAMISM OF THE 
WILL</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Reference to the Ego as Object Is Essential to 
Self-Determination</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Self-determination, that is, the will as an essential of the 
person rooted in self-governance and self-possession, reveals in the dynamic 
order the objectiveness of the person or, in other words, of every concrete, 
consciously acting ego. We are not concerned here solely with ontological 
objectiveness, with the fact a person is objectively and really a being, 
somebody actually existing, for this was the object of our account in the 
preceding chapter. What we are now concerned with is that in this action the 
person is, owing to self-determination, an object for himself, in a peculiar way 
being the immanent target upon which man's exercise of all his powers 
concentrates, insofar as it is he whose determination is at stake. He is in this 
sense, the primary object or the nearest object of his action.</P>
<P align=justify>Every actual act of self-determination makes real the 
subjectiveness of self-governance and self-possession; in each of these 
interpersonal structural relations there is given to the person as the subject - 
as he who governs and possesses - the person as the object -as he who is 
governed and possessed. This objectiveness is, as may be seen, the correlate of 
the person's subjectiveness and, moreover, seems to bring out in a specific 
manner subjectiveness itself. At the same time, this objectiveness constitutes 
an essential correlate of that complexity which, together with the structure of 
self-governance and self-possession, manifests itself in man, in the human 
person.</P>
<P align=justify>The objectiveness we are now considering is realized by and 
also manifested in self-determination. In this sense we may speak of an 
"objectification" that is introduced together with self-determination into the 
specific dynamism of the person. This objectification means that in every actual 
act of self-determination - in every "I will" - the self is the object, indeed 
the primary and nearest object. This is contained in the concept itself, and the 
term expressing it - "self-determination" - means that one is determined by 
oneself. The concept as well as the word expressing it contain simultaneously 
and correlatively both the subject and the object. The one as well as the other 
is the ego.</P>
<P align=justify>Nevertheless, the objectification of the subject does not have 
an intentional character in the sense in which intentionality is to be found in 
every human willing. When I will, I always desire something. Willing indicates a 
turn toward an object, and this turn determines its intentional nature. In order 
to turn intentionally to an object we put the object, as it were, in front of us 
(or we accept its presence). Obviously it is possible to put in this position 
our own ego as the object and then to turn to it by a similar volitional act, 
the act of willing. But this kind of intentionality does not properly appertain 
to self-determination. For in self-determination we do not turn to the ego as 
the object, we only impart actuality to the, so to speak, ready-made 
objectiveness of the ego which is contained in the intrapersonal relation of 
self-governance and self-possession. This imparting of actuality is of 
fundamental significance in morality, that specific dimension of the human, 
personal existence which is simultaneously both subjective and objective. It is 
there that the whole reality of morals, of moral values, has its 
roots.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Objectification Is More Fundamental than the Intentionality of 
Volitions</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The objectification that is essential for self-determination 
takes place together with the intentionality of the particular acts of the will. 
When I will anything, then I am also determined by myself. Though the ego is not 
an intentional object of willing its objective being is contained in the nature 
of acts of willing. It is only thus that willing becomes self-determination. 
Self-determination does not mean merely proceeding from the ego, as the source 
and initial point of willing and choice; it means also the specific returning to 
that same ego which is its primary and basic object and with regard to which all 
intentional objects - everything and anything one wills or wants - are in a way 
more remote, transitory and just as external. The most direct and innermost is 
the objectiveness of the ego, that is, of the ego's own subject. This subject is 
formed by man in one way or another when he desires an object, a value of some 
kind. At this point we touch upon the innermost personal reality of the action: 
by <I>forming his ego in one way or another man becomes someone or someone else. 
</I>This shows how deeply rooted is the objectification referred to here, that 
is to say, the objectiveness of self-determination:<SUP>39 </SUP>the 
objectiveness of the ego in self-determination.</P>
<P align=justify>The tendency toward this objectification is contained as a 
function of self-determination in the dynamism of the will, but its foundations 
reach down to the structure itself of the person to self-governance and 
self-possession. Mention was already made of the impossibility of understanding 
and interpreting correctly the will without a clear idea of the way in which it 
proceeds from the structure of the person, in the specifically personal 
structure of the human being. It would be impossible to present the peculiar 
dynamism of the will if we were to refer only to the intentionality of the 
particular volitions. Willing as an intentional act, that is to say, an 
experience directed toward its proper object, which may be defined both as an 
end and as a value, differs from the experience of "I will" in its full content. 
For the experience of "I will" contains also self-determination and not only 
intentionality. The turning to any external object that is seen as an end or a 
value implies a simultaneous fundamental turn toward the ego as the 
object.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Determination and the Distinction between the Experiences 
of "I will" and "I am willing"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Volition as an intentional act is embedded in the dynamism of 
the will only to the extent self-determination is contained in it. Introspection 
informs us of various types of volition that arise in man's interior life and 
are authentic intentional acts but which are not embedded in the proper dynamism 
of the will. We may then say that some kind of volition is "happening" in the 
subject even when man does not will - it does not emerge with the experience "I 
will." An important point to note in this connection is that it lies in the 
nature of the experience of "I will," in the nature of the will itself, that it 
never consists in something that only happens in man; on the contrary, it always 
occurs as an instance of "acting," indeed, is the very core of every acting. It 
is the person as such that is then "active." All the same, volitions, including 
those that are not within the frame of self-determination, are - according to 
the phenomenological conception - intentional acts. We see them directed toward 
a value which they adopt as their end; their directing toward it may sometimes 
be very acutely experienced and, for instance, their "appetitive" character then 
becomes specially evident. Even such acuteness is, however, insufficient to 
ascertain the will. This situation becomes clearer when we compare the 
experience of "I will" with that of "I want." In either case we deal with a type 
of volition, but only the former contains in it the true dynamism of the 
will.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experience of "I will" Reveals the Transcendence of the 
Person in the Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The dynamism of the will cannot be reduced to volition with its 
specific intentionality. An essential trait of this dynamism is that it involves 
the person in its own specific structure of self-governance and self-possession. 
It is thus that every genuine "I will" reveals the person's transcendence in the 
action. The significance of this transcendence, noted in the preceding chapter, 
will here be submitted to a more comprehensive analysis. At any rate, it is 
connected with self-determination and the objectification peculiar to 
self-determination and not solely with the human ego's "subjectiveness" or the 
intentionality of volitions that arise within the ego and are directed outward 
to various values as their goal.</P>
<P align=justify>The term "objectification" is here used to bring to attention 
the objectiveness of the ego itself, the objectiveness that manifests itself 
every time man says "I will." In philosophical and psychological tradition the 
tendency seems to have prevailed to consider the human willing somewhat 
one-sidedly, mainly from the point of view of the outside object, emphasis being 
laid on the "willing of something," rather than from that of the inner 
objectiveness, of the simple willing itself. From the latter point of view human 
willing has special significance first for the philosophy of the person - in our 
considerations the acting person - and then in a more distant perspective for 
personalistic ethics. Occasionally one should be attentive not to confound in 
the consideration of action as human action, the acting person with the action 
of the person. This is by no means a mere play on words but a meaningful 
distinction relevant to the interpretation of the action. The problem lies in 
defining how the human act, the action, is the real act of the person; for in it 
not only is an individual rational nature actualized, but also an act is 
performed - as evidenced in experience - by the unique individual person. The 
performing of an action is at once the fulfillment of the person. Here 
"fulfillment" may be regarded as having a correlative meaning with 
"actualization" and thus with the metaphysical meaning of the term "act." 
Nevertheless, experience, intuition, and the phenomenological analysis connected 
with it allow us to take a new look at the person-action relation, and this may 
play an important and fruitful role in the interpretation of the action as the 
act of the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>In Self-Determination the Reference to the Ego as Object Is 
Influenced by Consciousness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>From the metaphysical point of view the person is both the 
object and the subject. He is an objective being or somebody - a being existing 
as "somebody" in contrast with all other beings existing as "something" - at the 
same time he is his own ontological foundation, which means he exists as the 
subject of his own structures and dynamisms. Already in the discussion of the 
preceding chapter, in which we dealt with the person and the action in relation 
to the general dynamism of man, we noted that in the person we had to consider a 
kind of synthesis of efficacy and subjectiveness. Since we are now considering 
the integral dynamism of the will we have first to gain a deeper insight into 
the problem of efficacy. This will bring us to view, as it were, a new dimension 
of the synthesis of efficacy and subjectiveness; for we shall now see the 
objectiveness appropriate to efficacy, the dynamic core of which consists in 
self-determination identifiable with the experience of "I will." 
Self-determination puts the ego, that is to say, the subject, in the place of 
the object. Thus simultaneously it effects the objectiveness of the ego in 
subjectiveness.</P>
<P align=justify>The objectification of the ego that is derived from 
self-determination has as its correlate in the integral dynamism of the will, 
and also in the specific structure of the person himself, the subjectification 
that consciousness reveals in the personal structure. The person, so far as he 
is a specific existent possessing consciousness, lives in his own peculiar 
fashion (to "live" is here understood in the sense of the vital existence of 
living beings); he lives - or exists - not only in his own reflection, the 
mirrored image the person has of himself, but also in that specific 
self-experience which is conditioned by the reflexive function of consciousness. 
Owing to this function the man-person has the experience of himself as the 
subject, as the subjective ego. The experience of his own subjectiveness is, as 
it were, superimposed on the "metaphysical subjectiveness" of the human 
ontological foundation.</P>
<P align=justify>Although objectification is brought about by the will as 
self-determination, this takes place within the frame or, we may perhaps say, in 
the current of the simultaneous, actual subjectification by consciousness. After 
all, man has the experience of each of his willings, of every act of 
self-determination, and this makes of it a thoroughly subjective fact. We then 
see the subject as if it were ceaselessly disclosed in its innermost 
objectiveness; we witness the disclosing, so to speak, of the objective 
constructing of the ego's own subject. When consciousness brings all this into 
the orbit of experience, then the inner objectiveness of the action, the 
objectification proper to self-determination, stands out sharply in the profile 
of the full subjectiveness of the person who experiences himself as the acting 
ego. Then the person, the acting ego, also experiences the awareness that <I>he 
is the one who is determined by himself </I>and that <I>his decisions make him 
become somebody, </I>who may be good or bad - which includes at its basis the 
awareness of the very fact of his being somebody.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Will Is Governed by the Objectifying Function of 
Cognition</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>While it is true that the experiencing of self-determination is 
conditioned by consciousness, there are no grounds to suppose that it is also 
guided by consciousness. In point of fact, the guidance of the cognitive 
function, which is indispensable in self-determination, in the dynamization of 
the will (as confirmed by experience and supported by philosophical tradition as 
well as empirical psychology), should on no account be confused either with the 
mirroring or the reflexive function of consciousness. The last of these 
functions plays an important role in objectification, which has an essential 
significance for man. The guidance of the cognitive function, on the other hand, 
has an objectifying character. Thus, if self-determination and the whole 
dynamism of the will are to be guided by anything (this applies first of all to 
the intentionality of the will, to its orientation toward values or aims in 
general), then this can only be self-knowledge together with man's whole 
knowledge of the existing reality, in particular, his knowledge of values as 
possible ends and also as the basis of the norms that he refers to in his 
acting.</P>
<P align=justify>The objectiveness of self-determination and volition can only 
be correlated with the objectiveness of cognition. It is only by its 
objectifying function that cognition guides the will: nothing may be the object 
of will unless it is known. In its subjectifying function of consciousness, on 
the other hand, it accompanies the will and supplements it within the framework 
of the specific structure presented by the person, but it does not guide or 
control the will. Failure to recognize this fundamental difference leads 
inevitably to solipsism, subjectivism, and idealism, that is, to a situation in 
which the subject seems lost in its own specific reality or objectiveness. This 
assertion also has a vital significance for the interpretation of the action. 
When speaking of conscious acting we stress primarily and basically the guiding 
function of cognition in acting and not only the awareness or the aspect of 
consciousness that accompany it.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Dialectics of Objectification and Subjectification 
Appropriate to the Integral Dynamism of Will</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>This is how the acting person - the person acting consciously - 
reveals himself as a specific synthesis of objectiveness with subjectiveness. 
Looking at the two - as representing the "inner" and "outer" aspect of the 
integral human experience - and taking into account the experience of morality, 
we come to the conclusion that objectification and subjectification mutually 
supplement and in a way balance each other out. In this sense consciousness 
supplements and is the counterpoise of self-determination and vice versa. While 
consciousness, as was already asserted in Chapter 2, brings with it 
subjectification as well as a certain measure of inwardness: self-determination 
introduces also some outwardness.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Immanent Act Is Also an External Manifestation of the 
Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Every action is an external manifestation of the person, even 
when it is wholly performed internally. But an action confined strictly in its 
process as well as manifestations to the performing subject alone may be called 
an "immanent act." Such action does not even involve anything of what in man 
makes his acting externally manifested and discernible. An act that carries the 
features of a manifestation external to the performing subject has been termed 
by some contemporary philosophers "transcendent." But the external 
discernibility is not the only, and even less the best, test of that outwardness 
with regard to the person which we assert in the action. For the person is not 
only objectified in every one of his actions but also manifests himself 
externally even if its actions have, from the point of view of the criterion of 
discernibility, all the traits of immanence. On the other hand, parallel to the 
subjectification due to consciousness every action, however external it may 
appear, also remains to a certain degree immanent to the subject who performs 
it. We now see that the synthesis of objectiveness with subjectiveness is thus 
projected in the dynamic image of the person as the synthesis of externality 
with immanence.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>3. FREE WILL AS THE BASIS OF THE TRANSCENDENCE OF THE ACTING 
PERSON</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Self-Determination Reveals Freedom as a Uniquely Personal 
Factor</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The preceding discussion allows us to grasp the fundamental 
significance of the free will. We may now identify freedom with 
self-determination, with the self-determination we discover in the will as a 
constitutive element of the personal structure of man. Freedom thus manifests 
itself as connected with the will, with the concrete "I will," which includes, 
as noted, the experience of "I may but I need not." In the analysis of 
self-determination we reach right down to the very roots of the experience of "I 
will" as well as of "I may but I need not." The freedom appropriate to the human 
being, the person's freedom resulting from the will, exhibits itself as 
identical with self-determination, with that experiential, most complete, and 
fundamental organ of man's autonomous being.</P>
<P align=justify>We are thus considering freedom as real, the freedom that 
constitutes the real and privileged position of man in the world and also the 
main condition of his will. This premise is of essential significance, inasmuch 
as any discussion concerning the free will, if it starts with the concept of 
freedom as such instead of the reality that is man risks deviating into an 
unwarranted idealism.<SUP>40</SUP> The fact of self-determination and all that 
self-determination relies upon in the structure itself of the person, namely, 
self-governance and self-possession, provides the key to the reality of the 
person we are attempting to reach. Indeed, self-determination manifests itself 
as the force holding together the human dynamism and integrating it at the level 
of the person. We may now distinguish between the dynamism at the level of the 
person and the dynamism at the level of nature. The latter does not seem to 
contain the necessary factors for self-determination, and we may thus conclude 
that neither does it contain any acting in the sense we have established in the 
preceding chapter.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Difference between the Dynamisms of Self-Determination and 
Instinct</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Let us reaffirm that at the level of the dynamism of nature 
itself there is no acting, there are no actions, but only what, strictly 
speaking, we may call "activations"; at this level there is in every particular 
instance a specific sum total of all that is taking place in the subject and 
that forms the distinct whole of its life and of its dynamism. The formation of 
this whole is oriented in a certain direction or along a kind of bioexistential 
axis, which depends on the natural endowment of every individual being or on its 
potentiality. Thus nature may to some extent be identified with the potentiality 
that lies at the origin of activations themselves. The significance of "nature," 
however, is broader than the sphere of activations alone and extends also, or 
even primarily, to the direction of, or the general trend in, the integration of 
these activations. Thus all that happens in an individual being bears the mark 
of some purpose, which depends on this direction. The subjective basis for both 
the integration and the purpose at the level of nature is called - especially in 
animals - "instinct." Instinct is not to be confused, in spite of close 
similarity of meaning, with drive, which will be considered in some detail 
later.</P>
<P align=justify>It is by instinct that in an individual animal everything that, 
strictly speaking, only happens in it receives direction and is brought together 
into a whole, which may give the impression of acting even though it is - 
however splendid in its own way it may appear - but a coordination of 
activations. Acting - the action in the strict sense, that is, in the sense that 
finds justification solely in the total experience of the human being - can be 
spoken of only in the case of self-determination. When, however, instinct is the 
guiding force we only have a certain external analogy with acting; the operating 
dynamism has the semblance of acting but does not satisfy the essential 
conditions of acting, of the action.</P>
<P align=justify>The reasoning just presented in order to introduce some 
necessary comparisons leads us further afield than the experience of man alone, 
it brings us, as explicitly stated, to the world of animals. The problem in 
itself has many, obviously interesting, aspects but this is not the place to 
consider them in detail. The point to be made here in connection with these 
comparisons is that the dynamism at the level of nature is in opposition to the 
dynamism at the level of the person, and that the cause of this opposition is 
the fact of self-determination. In the dynamism at the level of nature there is 
no self-determination to serve as the basis from which acting itself as well as 
its direction and purpose are derived. The dynamism at the level of nature lacks 
that special dependence on the ego which is the characteristic mark of the 
specific dynamism of the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Free Will Reflects the Self-Dependence of the 
Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is the dependence of acting on the ego that serves as the 
basis of freedom, while the absence of this dependence places the whole dynamism 
of any individual being (say an animal being) beyond the sphere of freedom. 
"Necessity" is the conceptual equivalent of the lack of freedom. Necessity as 
the opposite of freedom - which owing to self-determination is exclusively 
"personal" - is thus attributed to the dynamism at the level of nature alone, 
the dynamism that has instinct as its integrating factor. The person is 
dynamized in his own manner only when in the dynamization he depends on his ego. 
This is precisely what is contained in the experiential essence of 
self-determination and what conditions the experiencing of efficacy. In this' 
case efficacy derives from freedom.</P>
<P align=justify>Special note should be taken of the fact that the fundamental 
significance of man's freedom and of his free will, elucidated in its concrete 
exercise and experience, brings to the forefront the relational network 
establishing the exercise of its dynamism in its essential dependence on the 
ego. It is at this point that the realism of experience belies the idealism of 
pure abstraction: for taken in abstraction from the concrete notions among the 
elements of the person, freedom may be seen as epitomized by "independence" from 
all possible factors. Actually, however, the reverse is true. The lack of the 
relational concatenations of numerous factors within and with reference to the 
structure of the man-person in its dependence on the ego in the dynamization of 
the subject precludes the freedom of human action; this latter has then no 
proper groundwork to emerge from by its own proper mechanism. It is here that 
there runs the intuitive, best evidenced line dividing within a primitive type 
of experience the person from nature, the world of persons from the world of 
individuals (e.g., animal individuals), whose whole dynamism is limited to the 
level of nature. In this last case the distinctive trait is the lack in their 
dynamization of a necessary connection with the ego. In point of fact, the 
structure of mere individuals differs from that of the person. We do not find in 
it the structural-dynamical complexes which we have earlier identified as 
"self-governance" and "self-possession" and which form the structural condition 
of self-determination. At the level of nature, the dynamism of the individual 
flows in and is absorbed by the potentiality of its own subject, which 
consequently establishes the direction of dynamization (e.g., instinct is a 
manifestation of nature's directing the functioning of an Individual as well as 
of the actualization of this supremacy).</P>
<P align=justify>Such a structural connectedness is possible chiefly due to the 
absence of the ego. In fact, within natural species as such there are only 
individuals but no constituted egos. The necessary factor in constituting the 
ego, that is, the person in his strictly experiential profile and content, is 
the presence of consciousness and self-determination. It is through 
self-determination that the transcendence of the person in the action is 
justified, whereas the action itself is constituted as the <I>act </I>of the 
<I>person </I>(which we have clearly differentiated from the <I>acting person). 
</I>Action so understood reveals the experiential moment of the relation and 
dependence upon the ego, in which consists, first, the very foundation of 
personal freedom. With freedom it accounts, second, for the <I>person's 
transcendence in the action.</P><B>
<P align=justify>The Contextual Meaning of the Transcendence of the 
Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>At this stage it seems necessary to examine the idea of 
"transcendence" more closely - in particular, the sense in which the term is 
used in this study. Etymologically "transcendence" means to go over and beyond a 
threshold or a boundary <I>(trans-scendere). </I>This may refer to the subject's 
stepping out of his limits toward an object, as is in different ways the case in 
what is known as intentional acts of external ("transcendent") perception. The 
manner in which the subject transgresses his limits in this type of cognitive 
act differs from his outgoing in acts of willing, whose character is conative. 
Later in our study we will consider in more detail the characteristic features 
of the particular intentional acts. Transgressing the subject's limits in the 
direction of an object - and this is intentionality in the "external" perception 
or volition of external objects - may be defined as "horizontal transcendence." 
But it is not the kind of transcendence we are concerned with when speaking of 
the transcendence of the person in the action (though, as we shall see later, 
the other is also involved). The transcendence we are now considering is the 
fruit of self-determination; the person transcends his structural boundaries 
through the capacity to exercise freedom; of being free in the process of 
<I>acting, </I>and not only in the intentional direction of willings toward an 
external object.<SUP>41 </SUP>This kind of transcendence we shall call "vertical 
transcendence," in contrast to the other kind of transcendence that we have 
called horizontal.</P>
<P align=justify>Thus conceived, transcendence as an essential of the person can 
be best characterized by comparing the dynamism of the person with the dynamism 
of nature. First, concerning the person, self-determination accounts for the 
dominant position of the ego. This dominance serves as a kind of guide line. In 
contrast, there is no such domination in an individual who is but the subject of 
activations coordinated by instinct. On the one hand, by analogy with the 
expression "the acting person," we should use the expression "the acting 
individual." On the other hand, the adequate and fundamental formulation of the 
action finds its expression in "human action" which only by analogy can be 
tentatively transposed to nonpersonal individuals as "individual action," though 
in fact there is nothing to justify this definition. Acting, the action, in the 
strict sense cannot occur where there are no means to make one's dynamization 
depend on the ego.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Role of the Objectification of the Ego in the Structure of 
Freedom</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The fundamental significance of man's freedom, of the exercise 
of his "free will," forces us to see in freedom first of all that special 
self-reliance which goes together with self-determination. To say that man "is 
free" means <I>that he depends chiefly on himself for the dynamization of his 
own subject. </I>Hence the fundamental significance of freedom presupposes the 
objectification which we discussed earlier. The precondition of freedom is the 
concrete ego, which while it is the subject is also the object determined by the 
acts of will. The dynamism at the level of nature alone, to which we refer as an 
illustrative comparison, does not manifest that objectiveness of the subject. 
This deficiency was already asserted on the occasion of the analyses in the 
preceding chapter, where the distinction was drawn between subjectiveness and 
efficacy. We noted then that the ontological foundation when there is something 
only happening in it, manifests subjectiveness alone; but when it acts it 
manifests its subjectiveness together with efficacy. As the efficacy is based on 
self-determination and as the subject efficaciously determines itself, it is 
then also its own object. This is how objectification enters into the 
fundamental significance of freedom: it conditions the self-reliance.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>4. THE SiGNIFICANCE OF THE WILL AS THE PERSON'S POWER OF 
SELF-DETERMINATION</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Autodeterminism Conditions Independence in Relation to 
Intentional Objects of Volition</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Having indicated the fundamental significance of freedom we may 
now consider it in greater detail. Indeed, we discover the structure of freedom 
in volitions as intentional acts directed toward a value as their end. This 
structure is not confined solely to the willing itself in the act "I will" but 
comprises the whole sequence "I will something." It is here that we come upon a 
specific independence of the act of will from its object. For if we just want 
one thing or another - an X or a <I>Y - </I>then we experience an intentional 
directing toward the object as the freedom from compulsion or necessity: thus I 
may, but I need not, desire the object of my willing. But on the contrary, once 
our willing is set on object X or <I>Y </I>that has been presented to it, then 
obviously we are already, so to speak, past the threshold of choice and 
decision. Our willing now has a <I>definite </I>object - it has its value-end - 
and has thus been determined; if it were not, it would be but <I>hesitant. 
</I>Nevertheless, even in this determination the experience of "I may, but I 
need not" is somehow continued; the definition of value as the end or aim of 
conation does not abolish altogether my intrinsic independence from the object 
of volition.</P>
<P align=justify>Before we examine further the significance of freedom, we have 
to emphasize that this inner independence of the ego in relation to the 
intentional objects of volition (i.e., the value-end) is justified by 
self-reliance. Thus any interpretation of the free will, if it is to conform to 
reality, must rely on man's <I>autodeterminism </I>instead of floating in the 
air by stressing merely <I>indeterminism. </I>It is clearly visible in the 
structure of experience that in the interpretation of the functional aspect of 
freedom indeterminism assumes a secondary role while autodeterminism has primary 
and fundamental significance. This approach is strictly related to the main 
current of our entire discussion, in which the will has been shown as 
manifesting itself first of all in self-determination; the will is indeed a mode 
of functioning of the person and is firmly rooted in the structure of 
self-governance and self-possession.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Dynamism of Self-Determination Consists in Man's Use of the 
Will</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Experience discloses that will is not only a property of the 
person but is also a power.<SUP>42 </SUP>The will then appears like another 
experiential aspect of the same reality. For we call "will" not only what 
reveals and actualizes the structure of self-governance and self-possession but 
also what man resorts to, and even in a way makes use of, in order to achieve 
his aims. From this point of view, the will is subordinate in relation to the 
person, and does not determine or govern the person. The experience of the 
subordination of the factcir of will to the complete set up of the person is 
also important for understanding the problem of freedom. The expression "free" 
will does not mean some kind of independence of will from the person. If we 
agree that the freedom of will manifests itself in experiencing that "I may but 
I need not," then it expresses the person who <I>may </I>but need not use his 
freedom as a power. This is precisely the reason why the first stage in the 
crystallization of the free will within the personal functioning is the primary 
and elementary fact that flows from the person, or from the person's power of 
self-determination. Thereby the elementary manifestation of free will 
simultaneously brings to light the person's exclusive power to control the will. 
Independence appears there as reliance of man upon external conditions 
constituted and formed through his immanent structure of self-reliance and the 
indeterministic feature of will through man's intrinsic structure of his 
autodetermination. It is because of the person's exclusive power over the will 
that <I>will is the person's power to be free.</P></I>
<P align=justify>The interpretation of the will as a power, as proceeding from 
as well as serving the person to achieve self-determination, which is 
simultaneously a striving toward a value-end, brings us back to the discussion 
of the preceding chapter on the interrelation of dynamism and potentiality. It 
is to the will that the person owes his specifically human form of dynamism, the 
dynamism of self-determination, and the dynamism of the human action. This 
dynamism must have as its correlate an appropriate potentiality. When in the 
terms of traditional philosophical anthropology we say will is a power, it is 
this potentiality that we have in mind. Such potentiality is contained - 
according to the same traditional terms - in the rational nature of man. But 
"rational nature" has real existence solely and exclusively as a person. The 
will is dynamized in a way in which only a person could accomplish it - in a way 
in which nature alone could not. To conclude then, we can assert that freedom is 
the specific factor through which the person is dynamized, while the 
dynamization of nature we have attributed solely to the instinct.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Meaning of the Instinct of Freedom</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Within the dynamism appropriate to the person and his acting we 
may also detect the "instinct of freedom." But the phrase may be used only in a 
metaphorical sense. It then denotes that, for the person, self-determination is 
something absolutely proper and innate, even something "natural" - after all, we 
do speak of the nature of the person. On the one hand, when a person is acting, 
he is "dynamized" within the functional system of self-determination and will: 
they manifest themselves in their specific way spontaneously and so to speak, 
"instinctively" in his acting. On the other hand, the person as such repudiates 
a merely instinctive acting, since his dynamism, as we have attempted to show, 
is neither directed nor integrated by instinct.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Meaning of the Phrase "Man's Instinctive 
Acting"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Probably not even when man himself refers to his acting as 
instinctive can we regard his dynamism as functioning solely at the level of 
nature. For instance, he <I>instinctively </I>turns away from danger or pain and 
he instinctively reaches for food when hungry. It would be difficult to 
interpret this kind of instinctive acting without an analysis of the notion of 
"drive" in the sense in which it occurs in man. First, we have to assert that 
man not only acts but is also the subject of all that happens in him. Much light 
is shed on this problem by the drive aspect connected with bodily potentiality 
and also with the natural emotivity of man (these will be more fully discussed 
below). At any rate, neither potentiality nor impulsions are to be identified 
with instinct as the factor integrating the dynamism of an individual and 
determining its direction. It seems therefore that very often when speaking of 
man's instinctive acting we actually refer to an enhanced spontaneity or even a 
greater intensity of acting with a simultaneous decline in the clarity of 
self-determination. Self-determination is identifiable with deliberate choice 
and decision; "spontaneity" or even "impulsive acting" may, on the contrary, be 
interpreted as an orientation of the drive itself insofar as it is connected 
with the bodily potentiality (or even some tendency to emotiveness).<SUP>43 
</SUP>It is through the predominance of this orientation that conscious 
decisions are limited and may be sometimes blocked out.</P>
<P align=justify>The potentiality of the will is set off and enhanced in 
conscious choice and decision; it <I>is </I>the power of conscious choice and 
decision. This is the point of view we take in the discussion that follows. But 
marginally to what has been said about man's instinctive acting, we have first 
to note that, although self-determination is appropriate and even natural to the 
person, there is in man a certain tension between, on the one hand, his will as 
the power of self-determination - the power of deliberate choice and decision - 
and, on the other, his bodily potentiality, emotiveness, and impulsions. 
Experience tells us that it is in this tension rather than the simple and pure 
self-determination that consists the lot of man. Only in the perspective of this 
tension can we see the complex nature of the dynamism of the human person.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>5. DECISION IS THE FOCUS OF THE ACTIVITIES OF FREE WILL</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;<I>Transcendence versus Appetite</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The remainder of this chapter will be almost entirely concerned 
with the extended significance of freedom, and we shall thereby continue to 
constructively complete our image of the person. This image emerges more 
completely alongside the increasing prominence given to the transcendence in the 
action which, owing to freedom, that is, self-determination, is the privilege of 
the person. Because of the fact itself of being free - the fact of 
self-determination and its related ascendancy over the human dynamism - we call 
this transcendence "vertical." The experience of this ascendancy is not impeded 
by the spontaneity of freedom, though the ascendancy is perhaps better marked 
when there is more reflectiveness in self-determination, in the rational 
maturation of decisions. At any rate, now that we are equipped with a more or 
less clearly defined notion of "vertical transcendence," we can embark upon a 
deeper analysis of the will. The consecutive steps of this analysis will, so to 
speak, unveil deeper and deeper levels of that transcendence of the acting 
person in which the person's structure, in its existential status of reality, is 
manifested experientially. The outer, overlying layers of this reality, those we 
can uncover and objectify first, are conditioned by the inner ones, and as we 
proceed in depth each will tell us more about the person, about his specific 
structure. They will allow us to define more and more fully the person's 
specificity and his spiritual nature.</P>
<P align=justify>This procedure for the analysis of will and, at the same time, 
the in-depth study of the person's inner structure, seems to differ in some 
respects from the traditional approach, in which the will seems to be viewed 
rather in the dimension of "horizontal" transcendence. Some philosophers and 
psychologists in their discussions and analyses have treated it as if it were an 
"appetite." Their stand brought into promlnence, not without reason, the will's 
characteristic urge toward good as its object and end. Thus the most important 
part of the analysis of the will was that which dealt with its intentionality, 
with the intentional acts or volitions whereby it was manifested and actualized. 
It seems, however, that an analysis of volitions themselves with all their 
variety of tone and all their modifications fails to bring us right down to the 
roots of the will. For these grow out - as we have been trying to demonstrate - 
from the structure of the person: and apart from this structure the will finds 
no justification. As to the intentionality of willings, the turn they manifest 
toward a value-end is insufficient to constitute or determine the will fully and 
comprehensively or to allow a sufficiently clear insight into the dynamism and 
potentiality appropriate to it.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Appetition, Intendedness, and Intentionality</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Special note ought to be taken of the term "appetite," 
especially when used in conjunction with the attributive "rational." Its content 
with all its connotations has to be closely examined and properly grasped. There 
is in it the element of striving, and as striving is necessarily directed toward 
an end, appetite is intrinsically incident to an end. But there is also in 
appetite an element of desire, which, insofar as will is concerned, adds to the 
term a certain semantic convergence as well as a divergence. For desire, with 
its connotations, seems to point only in the direction of what is <I>happening 
</I>in man, to what lies beyond the range of his conscious decision. Thus from 
this point of view, to speak of "rational appetite" seems somewhat strange, 
almost a contradiction in terms, though at the same time the element of conation 
makes "appetite" more neutral and seems to offset the contradiction.</P>
<P align=justify>From the semantic point of view appetite can hardly be 
attributed to the will, at any rate, to the extent to which it retains any 
connotation of sensual passivity and as such originates and unfolds on its own, 
spontaneously, outside of conscious choice and decision. In this context 
questions of language and terminology are by no means futile; our purpose is to 
find a definition that would be in all respects' adequate for every human 
willing or, more broadly speaking, for every "I will something," regardless of 
whether the desired object be X or <I>Y. </I>We are considering will as endowed 
with some features of "intentionality" that are appropriate to it but also with 
others diametrically different from the intentionality of cognition, of 
cognitive acts. We differentiate in fact between what could be termed 
"intention" and "intent."<SUP> 44</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>An intentional act of man's experience consists in being 
oriented or directed outward toward an object. Its "intention" is a special kind 
of going out toward an object, a motion in which the limits of the subject are 
overstepped. This takes place in acts of volition as well as in acts of 
cognition, of thinking. Being intentional the acts of thinking and volition 
resemble each other in that they are directed toward their object and thereby 
overstep the limits of the subject; but they differ In their whole specific 
nature. Beyond that, the act of will crystallizes Into a peculiar "intent." In 
this respect "to know" or "to understand" and "to will" are dissimilar. It is 
the distinction between "tending toward something," on the one hand, and "being 
intent upon something," on the other. In either case the experience the subject 
has of being directed toward an object has entirely different consequences for 
the subject and for the object. In this study we view thinking as an 
"intentional act" <I>par excellence, </I>distinguishing it clearly from an 
"intended" act as expressing foremostly the manifestation of will. Having 
introduced these explanations we can proceed to examine the act of 
volition.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Decision as the Crucial Constitutive Moment in the Experience 
of "I will"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The first point to make is that the moment of decision always 
forms part of volition envisaged as an intentional act, that is to say, in the 
specific way in which the will is directed toward its appropriate object. This 
moment is an essential part of volition and is crucial for both the inner 
structure and the dynamic distinctness of volition. It is contained in what 
psychologists, such as Ach or Michotte, call a "simple volitive act" as well as 
in what is sometimes referred to as a "compound" or "expanded" act.<SUP>4</SUP>S 
We shall later attempt an explanation of this distinction by examining the two 
kinds of volitive acts separately. At present it suffices to note that volition 
is present in our willing as its essential and constitutive moment, regardless 
of whether we simply want something or we choose something - that is to say, we 
want it at the conclusion of a process of motivation. Choice and decision define 
the intrinsic essence of volition (of "I will"), especially in what concerns its 
intentional attribution to an object ("I will either X or Y").</P>
<P align=justify>In true willing the subject is never passively directed to an 
object. The object - which may be a good or a value, though the meaning of these 
conceptions would require a separate differential analysis -never leads the 
subject back upon itself; it never forces the subject into its own reality 
thereby determining it from without; that kind of subject-object relation would 
in fact amount to determinism; it would mean that the subject was in a way 
absorbed by the object and also that innerness was absorbed by outerness. The 
moment of decision in the human will rules out any such pattern of relation. 
Thus when I will something, I myself am moving outward toward the object, toward 
whatever I will. We already saw that it is not the directing toward a value as 
such but the <I>being </I>directed that is appropriate to volition. The passive 
voice of "being directed" brings out very well the distinctness that results 
from the active engagement of the subject. It is here that we touch upon the 
root itself of the experiential difference between man's acting and the 
happening of what only occurs in man. The will is the factor of acting, of the 
action. The remarkable thing is that this is due to the mechanism of decision to 
which the will is essentially related. This relationship brings into full view 
the person in his efficacy as well as in his transcendence and, what is more 
important, it shows the person as a person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Readiness to Strive toward Good Underlies All Volitive 
Decisions</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Choice and decision are obviously no substitute for the drive 
toward good that is appropriate to will and constitutive of the multifarious 
dynamism of the human person. The greater the good the greater becomes its power 
to attract the will and thus also the person. The crucial factor in determining 
the maturity and the perfection of the person is his <I>consent </I>to be 
attracted by positive, authentic values, his unreserved consent to be drawn in 
and absorbed by them. But this makes it all the more necessary to stress that 
all the forms and degrees of such absorption or engagement of the will are made 
personal by the moment of decision.<SUP>46</SUP> Decision may be viewed as an 
instance of threshold that the person as a person has to pass on his way toward 
the good. Moreover, this personal outgoing has to continue throughout his 
absorption by the good, even when it may rightly appear that the human being 
will be literally engulfed by the good, by the glorified end of his striving. 
Indeed, the more he becomes engulfed, the more fundamental is his decision and 
vice versa. We may also look upon this interpretation from another side: the 
consequences of the initial decision augment as the good is approached, in the 
intercourse and union with it. But these consequences would never be possible 
without the person's going beyond the threshold of his own structural 
borderlines, transgressing his own limitations.</P>
<P align=justify>The will's ability to decide in no way condemns it to an 
attitude of cool aloofness either toward its object or toward values. Indeed, 
there are no grounds to assume that there is a neutral attitude to all values, a 
kind of indifference to their attractiveness and to their visible hierarchy in 
the world, lurking somewhere deep at the bottom of the person, at the origin of 
all the dynamizations that are proper to the will. On the contrary, it lies in 
the nature of every "I will" - which is always object oriented and consists in 
an "I want something" - that it is constantly prepared to come out towards a 
good. In a sense this readiness is more primitive and more fundamental for the 
dynamic essence of the will than the ability to make decisions; for the ability 
presupposes a dynamic readiness to strive toward good. If however we were to 
conceive of the will, of man's "I will," solely or even primarily in terms of 
this readiness, then we would miss what in the dynamism of the will is most 
essentially personal, what most strictly binds the dynamism of will with the 
structure of the person and through this structure allows us to exfoliate and 
interpret the nature of the person.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>6. RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ACTS OF WILL-MOTIVATION AND 
RESPONSE</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>What Is Motivation?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have to continue, or rather take up again from the 
beginning, our analysis of choice and decision, for it seems that so far we have 
only outlined the significance of the problem without going into its structure. 
Thus we have now to consider the structure of human decisions. But first we will 
examine in some detail the problem of motivation. By motivation we mean the 
effect motives have on the will, and this strictly corresponds to the 
intentionality of the will. When I want something, I approach the object that is 
presented, or rather that presents itself to my attention as a good and thus 
shows its value. Presentation is an essential element of motivation, its 
correlate on the side of man being a specific kind of cognition. It is broadly 
speaking the cognition of values. But as is evidenced by the term "motive" 
itself, which etymologically is derived from the Latin <I>movere </I>("to 
move"), more than this is contained in the notion of motive. We owe to 
motivation the impulsion, the movement of the will toward the object that is 
being presented - not just a turn toward it but an outright movement. To will 
means to strive after a value that thereby becomes an end. When Aristotle 
identified good with aim he only followed consistently in his reasoning the 
evidence available in elementary experience.</P>
<P align=justify>The subjective complexity of man requires precision and forces 
us to draw a sharp distinction between the impulsion of the will, which we owe 
to motivation, and emotions. This brings us to a very subtle boundary that runs 
within man and which may easily be overlooked if our in-depth vision is not 
sharp enough. We shall consider this boundary again when we come to the 
discussion of man's emotional life, of emotivity. Essentially, motives only 
stimulate the will but do not arouse emotions: they stimulate the will, which 
means that they stimulate man to will something, either X or <I>Y. </I>When I 
want something, I thereby simply will - even though our earlier considerations 
revealed a subtle difference between the one and the other. It is easy to 
establish that "I will" is something primary - like the foundation of the will - 
and durable in man, while the willing takes place in his intentionally directing 
himself toward different objects, this directing being secondary and variable. 
Motivation meets the variable intentionality of man's willing, it meets the 
possibility of attaching his willing to different objects that present 
themselves as values.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Motivation of Simple Willing and the Motivation of 
Choice</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>When psychologists discriminate between the simple act of will 
and the compounded or expanded one, they do so essentially because in either 
case the motivations have a different form, and this entails twO different forms 
of decisions appropriate to the will. A simple act of will corresponds to 
motivation of the kind in which the will is presented with only one object, only 
one motivating value. Then, because of the value presented in the object, man 
simply desires it, he experiences no internal split or doubts, he does not have 
to make a choice, which always entails a momentary suspension of the process of 
willing. We may then speak of an unequivocal motive and an unequivocal decision; 
for while choice is unnecessary there is still a decision to be made. The simple 
"I will something" or "I will X" is an authentic decision.</P>
<P align=justify>Far better than in a simple act of willing, the nature of 
decislon 15 expressed and visualized when the choice is preceded by a more 
complex and developed process of motivation. Such is the case when the will is 
presented with more than one object as the end of possible striving, when it can 
choose from a number of values, which perhaps compete against each other or may 
even be mutually contradictory. Each of them in its own way seems to vie with 
the others in attracting the will and in trying to win the human "I will." 
Unequivocal decisions are then impossible, at least not before a separate 
process, which precedes and conditions the decision and is sometimes defined as 
the deliberation of motives. The process deserves a detailed analysis of its 
own, which we cannot give here, though we shall have to consider some of its 
most important elements. Such an analysis would have to include, on the one 
hand, the object of motives, that is to say the domain of values, which can be 
seen clearly only against the background of the deliberation of motives. On the 
other hand, it is necessary to examine the willing itself with all its specific 
complexity and potentiality; for there are many potential willings that appear 
to be taking part in the deliberation of motives, so that the will may address 
itself, or rather is ready to address itself, to any of the values that are 
presented. This indirectly confirms that the versatile and multifarious 
readiness of striving toward good is primary and fundamental in the dynamic 
essence of the will.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Ability to Decide Is Seen in Choosing</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the deliberation of motives there is, besides the readiness, 
something akin to a momentary suspension of the process of willing. Not till the 
moment of decision, which in this case coincides with choice, can any one of the 
potential willings be actualized. In a simple decision there is no choice, 
because an unequivocal motive eliminates the need to choose. When motivation is 
complex each decision must become a choice. Man, then, not only has to decide to 
dynamize his own subject and thereby turn to an object, to some X or <I>Y, 
</I>but, in addition, has to decide to what object he is going to turn. It is 
this decision about the object of willing that we call "choice." And choice 
always entails the renunciation of a spectrum of objects, of possible values, 
for the sake of one single object or value. It also necessitates putting off 
some potential willings for the actual one. This one willing together with the 
chosen value forms a whole, in which the dynamic essence or nature of the will - 
and indirectly also the person in his transcendence - is visualized in a special 
way.</P>
<P align=justify>The one is interlinked with the other, and here again we find a 
confirmation of the view, which we have been emphasizing throughout this 
chapter, that the will is deeply rooted in the specific structure of the human 
person. In view of the whole process involved in an act of will, the 
deliberation of motives, and the suspension of willing, we come to the 
conclusion that what we call the "will" is not primarily connected with 
horizontal transcendence, with the subject's ability to go out toward the 
objects, which are the different values as objects of volition. What we call the 
"will" is primarily connected with the ability of decision, in which also the 
power to momentarily suspend willing in order to make a choice is contained. 
Thus the will is definitely included in the vertical transcendence, which is 
associated with self-governance and self-possession as the specific properties 
in the structure of the person. Indeed, it also determines and forms this 
transcendence. The ability to decide is more fully manifested in choice than in 
simple willing, though any "I choose" is also a definite "I will." We have thus 
a confirmation of the homogeneity of the will, notwithstanding the fact of the 
multiformity of the objectives of willing and also of the evolution in the forms 
that willing itself assumes according to whether motivation is simple or 
compound.</P>
<P align=justify>Considering the component itself of decision, which occurs in 
every act of will, whether simple or compound, we may say, on the one hand, that 
choice is willing expanded and enriched by the wealth of motivations and, on the 
other, that every simple willing is a choice reduced and simplified by the 
unambiguous plainness of motivation. For every time I make a decision, it has to 
be preceded by some sort of choice.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Free Will Manifests Itself in an Independent Determination of 
Objects</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>This brings us again to the question of freedom, which 
continues to be the object of our analyses in this chapter. It seems that in 
more than anything else, freedom is present and manifests itself in the ability 
to choose; for this ability confirms the independence of the will in the 
intentional order of willing. In choosing, the will is not cramped by the 
object, by the value as its end; it is the will and only the will that 
determines the object. This is how indeterminism enters into the formula of 
<I>autodeterminism. </I>Independence of the object, of the values as the end of 
willing, confirms for its part self-determination, which, so far as the grasping 
of the will is concerned, seems to be the most elemental experience of all. If, 
however, there was in man -within his whole accessible sphere of experience - 
anything that would allow his being determined in advance by the object in the 
intentional order, then self-determination would be impossible. Such 
determination would unavoidably abolish within the domain of the person the 
experience of efficacy and self-determination, the experience of decision or 
simply of willing. It would also mean the suppression of the person, insofar as 
in all these experiences he reveals himself and evidences his own existence. The 
person's exIstence is identical with the existence of a concrete central factor 
of freedom.</P>
<P align=justify>This freedom - the specific independence from objects in the 
intentional order, the ability to choose among them, to decide about them - does 
not, however, abolish the fact that man is conditioned in the broadest sense by 
the world of objects, in particular, by the domain of values. For his is not the 
freedom <I>from </I>objects or values, but, on the contrary, the freedom of, or 
rather <I>for </I>objects or values. We discover this meaning of freedom not 
only in the essence itself of the human "I will" but also in each of its forms. 
Willing is striving, and as such it carries in itself a form of dependence on 
objects, which does not however in any way abolish or destroy the independence 
that we find expressed in every simple willing and even more so in every choice 
- the independence that in either case is due to the fact of decision.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Original Dynamism of Acts of Will Disproves Moral 
Determinism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>There are those who, without due attention to the experiential 
nature of choice and decision, and on the grounds of the dependence on the world 
of objects alone, assert the existence of moral determinism; thus they reject 
freedom and indirectly also the person, indeed, the whole reality, that we have 
here defined as "the acting person." Determinism assumes its materialistic form 
when a certain preconception of matter tends to intervene into the 
interpretation of the experience of the person rather than to allow experience 
to present all its evidence to the end. This passing remark obviously cannot 
replace a full-scale discussion of the different materialistic treatments of 
determinism and this is not the place for it, the more so as our prime concern 
in this study is <I>to allow experience to speak for itself as best it can and 
right to the end. </I>As to the critical discussion of materialistic 
determinism, it suffices to consult any suitable handbook or treatise.</P>
<P align=justify>Besides the materialistic form of determinism there is also the 
view that associates determinism, which denies the freedom of the person, with 
what we have here accepted as the foundation of freedom or, to put it more 
concretely, as the condition of the decision present in every authentic "I 
will." Thus there is the line of thought that sees the irrevocable source of 
determinism in motivation, that is to say, in the presentation of the objects of 
will. According to this conception the will is restricted not by the object 
itself but by its presentation; inasmuch as man cannot desire an object without 
it being presented to him, his so-called choice in fact complies with the 
presentation; he chooses what is presented to him and how it is presented to 
him. For instance, if, as often happens, he chooses a lesser and passes by a 
greater good, this cannot be taken as evidence of free will, that is to say, an 
independence on objects, because interposed between the object and the will 
there is the presentation or motivation that definitely determines the direction 
of willing. Thus when as in our example man chooses a "lesser" good, he does so 
because <I>hic et nunc </I>it is presented to him as the "greater."</P>
<P align=justify>It seems, however, that hidden in this deterministic approach 
there is a far-reaching simplification, that it reduces the experience of the 
person to the point where the essentials are omitted or even sacrificed to a 
schematic pattern of thinking. In this connection much valuable service can be 
rendered by the phenomenological method with its suitability to exploit adroitly 
the available experiential data. The dynamic specificity appertaining to 
decision - whether in simple willing or in the more complex choosing - is 
essential in the will and is of the kind that makes impossible any 
determination. All determinism, not only by intentional objects (values) but 
also by the presentation of objects, is contrary to the original dynamism of 
decision. This is so because decision involves and reveals that relation to 
intentional objects as values which is proper solely to the will. The relation 
is to the object itself while presentation only establishes it and thereby 
enables and conditions decision. The deterministic thesis, that this relation is 
wholly constituted by presentation alone, fails to draw the distinction between 
the actual cause and a condition.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Act of Will as the Person's Response to the Appeal of 
Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Decision is connected with the dynamic structure of the 
"impulsion" that is essential in the will. The real cause of the impulsion is 
the good or value of the object, but the object has first to be presented. 
Presentation, however, does not in itself stimulate the impulsion of the will; 
it is, therefore, but a condition and can never be an essential factor either in 
determining or even in directing the impulsion. On the other hand, decision 
refers to objects themselves, to the presented values. It comprises not only a 
passive acceptance or assimilation of a presented value but also an authentic 
response to the value. Every instance of "I will" constitutes such an individual 
and unique response, which is specially apparent in every instance of 
choosing.</P>
<P align=justify>When the analysis of the will is conducted in the abstract, 
that is, when it is conducted so that will is viewed as if it were an 
Independent reality - an entity in itself - this remarkable trait of its 
dynamism may easily be lost. But if we place the analysis of the will within the 
framework of the whole dynamic structure that is constituted by the person and 
based on self-governance and self-possession, then the will is exhibited as 
self-determination while its relation to intentional objects is clearly seen as 
an active response. The ability to respond to presented values is will's 
characteristic trait. In making a decision man always responds to values. In his 
responding there is that independence with regard to objects which does not 
abolish all the bonds and thus leaves a certain measure of dependence on 
objects. Nevertheless, it is not the objects and values that have a grip of man; 
on the contrary, in his relation to them he governs himself: he is his own 
master. The reflexive pronoun shows best the essential active element of will. 
The specific response to the values presented in motivation seems to be 
indicative of the proper active demand of the will and at the same time also of 
what constitutes the acting of the person, what distinguishes acting from any 
submission to action, which is the term we have been using from the beginning to 
define all that only takes place, only <I>happens </I>in the person.</P>

<P align=center>7. THE MOMENT OF "TRUTH ABOUT GOOD" AS THE BASIS FOR THE ACTING 
PERSON'S PERCEPTION AND TRANSCENDENCE</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Dynamic Structure of the Object Common to Cognition and 
Will</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Our analyses seek to uncover deeper and deeper layers of the 
reality that is the action, while we continue to trace the primitive experience 
that allows us to distinguish between acting and happening in man. By asserting 
that the ability to respond to presented values is the characteristic trait of 
the will, which shapes the form of the process of acting, we uncover a new layer 
of our inquiry. It allows us to investigate the nature and conditions of the 
person which allow him to respond to the will. For in fact this responsiveness 
flows from the promptings of the intellectual sphere of the human person; it is 
in speech, implying thought, that we may see the first symptom of man's ability 
to respond either to values on the one hand or to the promptings of will on the 
other. The assertion that the active, dynamic ability to respond to values is a 
characteristic of the will, however, refers not only to a certain analogy 
between will and thought but also to the nature itself of the will. In 
traditional philosophy, from the great thinkers of the Middle Ages up to and 
including Leibniz, this nature of the will was conceived as the <I>appetitus 
rationalis. </I>This conception, which because of its conciseness and precision 
has become almost classical, allows us indeed to grasp that relation between 
will and cognition which has never ceased to be one of the most fascinating 
questions of philosophy and psychology.</P>
<P align=justify>It is expressed in the traditional view that nothing may become 
the object of will unless it is already known. The question still remains as to 
what is the common dynamic structure of the object as already known and as again 
object of the will.<SUP>47 </SUP>We will attempt to disclose this common dynamic 
structure on our own account in order to see how much a clarification of the 
relation between cognition and will contributes to the overall vision of man, of 
the person, and at the same time how deeply it is itself rooted in this vision. 
In attempting to elucidate this relation we find all those traces of 
interpretative integration and disintegration which ultimately must lead us to 
experience as the prime source of our knowledge of man. This is the reason why 
in our study we had first to conceive of experience as the source of cognition 
and knowledge and only then to consider the way of exploiting it for explanatory 
purposes. For experience and understanding together constitute a whole, and 
interpretation is interchangeable with comprehending.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Will's Reference to Truth as the Inner Principle of 
Decision</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The remarkable feature in the interpretation of acting, of the 
action, that we are presenting in this study is that the person is already 
presumed in it; to unveil step by step the reality of action we have 
simultaneously to uncover the deeper layers of the person. The person's dynamic 
activation is, on the one hand, the primordial experiential fact and, on the 
other, the final theme and objective of interpretation, which we are gradually 
approaching. Can this theme be fully explored, and is this final objective 
attainable? Or is our investigation only a series of successive approximations 
leading progressively to a better, more complete unfolding of our object, which 
is the acting person, and at the same time confirming the assertion that the 
person as such in his complete nature is rationally ungraspable, inexpressible? 
This last assertion paraphrases the classical definition, <I>individuum est 
ineffabile; </I>but as the person is an individual, though also more than an 
individual, the paraphrase seems permissible. At any rate, the assertion will be 
confirmed by our analysis, even though in our study we are considering the 
person as such and not just some concrete individual, a person-individual, 
hoping to bring to light this approach as self-justified.</P>
<P align=justify>Having made these general remarks, which have reference to the 
introductory considerations and principles already outlined in Chapter 1, we 
have to go back to our analysis at the point where we left it. The assertion of 
the specific nature of the will connected with the ability to decide and to 
choose allows us in turn to disclose another significant trait in the dynamism 
of the will: the reference to "truth." The reference to truth forms an intrinsic 
part of the very nature of a decision and is in a special manner manifest in 
choice. The essential condition of choice and of the ability to make a choice as 
such, seems to lie in the specific reference of will to truth, the reference 
that permeates the intentionality of willing and constitutes what is somehow the 
inner principle of volition. To "choose" does not mean to turn toward one value 
and away from others (this would be a purely "material" notion of choice). It 
does mean to make a decision, according to the principle of truth, upon 
selecting between possible objects that have been presented to the will. It 
would be impossible to understand choice without referring the dynamism proper 
to the will to truth as the principle of willing. This principle is, as we will 
see, intrinsic to the will itself, and at the same time constitutes the essence 
of choice. It is, also, by the same token, the essence of decision, and this 
includes also decisions with univocal motivations when only the so-called simple 
act of will is involved.</P>
<P align=justify>If striving for intentional objects according to the principle 
of the recognition of their validity as cognized were not to form part of the 
dynamic essence of the will, then it would be impossible to understand either 
choice or decision with all their dynamic originality. The hypothesis that the 
reference to truth has an entirely external origin, that it derives merely 
either from cognition - from a knowledge of the objects of choice - or simply 
from volition, is insufficient for the satisfactory interpretation of the 
relation between knowledge of the object of will and the act of will. Since it 
is owing to the knowledge of objects that the reference to truth is actualized, 
their knowledge is a necessary condition of choice and decision making; but the 
reference to truth, with all the originality proper to choice and decision 
making, is itself derived from the will and belongs to the will's own dynamism. 
The dynamism of will is not in itself cognitive; "to will" never means "to 
cognize or to know." It refers in a specific manner, however, and is internally 
dependent on, the recognition of truth. This is precisely the reason why it is 
accessible to cognition and specifically consistent with cognition. This in turn 
also explains the fact that in choosing and deciding, the will - and thus of 
course the person -<I>responds </I>to motives instead of being in one way or 
another only determined by them. The ability to respond is manifested by the 
"free will" conceived in the broad sense. From the above it seems evident that 
this response presupposes a reference to <I>truth </I>and not only a reference 
to the <I>objects </I>which elicit it.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Will's Dependence on Truth and Independence of 
Objects</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We have mentioned in our argument the will's "reference to 
truth" and also its accommodation to truth. These expressions adequately render 
the state of affairs that we are considering: for in the inner dynamism of will 
we discover a relation to truth that goes deeper and is different from the 
relation to the objects of volition. The relation to truth is not restricted to 
the structure of volition as an intentional act; nevertheless, it plays a 
decisive role in this act as proceeding from its anchorage in the person. In its 
element of choice and decision, every volition manifests its specific dependence 
on the person from whom it flows, a dependence that may be called the "surrender 
to truth." The exact meaning of this expression has to be fully explained. At 
any rate, it is the essential surrender of will to truth that seems finally to 
account for the person's transcendence in action, ultimately for his ascendancy 
to his own dynamism.</P>
<P align=justify>We said earlier that it is the transcendence that we owe to 
self-determination, that is, in the final analysis to the free will. The person 
"transcends" his actions because he is free and only so far as he is free. 
Freedom in its fundamental sense is equivalent to self-reliance. Freedom in the 
expanded sense is the acting person's intentional flexibility and partial 
independence with respect to the possible objects of volition, insofar as man is 
determined neither by the objects themselves nor by their presentation. His 
independence in the intentional sphere is to be explained by this inner 
reference to truth and dependence on truth inherent in the will. It is this 
dependence that makes will independent of objects and their presentation, and 
grants the person that ascendancy over his own dynamism which we have here 
described as the transcendence in action (as vertical transcendence). The person 
becomes independent of the objects of his own acting through the moment of 
truth, which is contained in every authentic choice of decision making.<SUP> 
48</P></SUP><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Moment of Truth and the Moral Value of Actions</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Let us stress once again the need to examine more precisely the 
"moment of truth." But first it is perhaps worth noting that this moment, which 
belongs to the will, is to be distinguished from the truthfulness of the 
<I>particular choices and decisions </I>that may be actually made. At the 
beginning of this study we mentioned the integral experience of man, in 
particular, his moral experience, and this point brings us back to it again. 
First, there is the painfully evident fact that not all of the particular 
choices or decisions of the human will are correct. Too often man seeks and 
chooses what is not good for him. Such a choice or decision is not just an 
error, because errors stem from the mind and not from the will. Choices and 
decisions, which take as their object what is not a "real good" -especially when 
contrary to what has been recognized as a real good - lead to the experience of 
"guilt," or "sin." But it is the reality of guilt - of sin or moral evil - known 
from the moral experience that brings to light explicitly the fact that the 
reference to truth and the inner dependence on truth is rooted in the human 
will.<SUP>49</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>If choice and decision were to be without their inherent moment 
of truth, if they were to be performed apart from that specific reference to 
truth, moral conduct most characteristic for the man-person would become 
incomprehensible. For it refers essentially to the opposition between what is 
morally good to what is morally bad. This opposition not only presupposes the 
will's specific relation to truth - insofar as will's intentionality is 
concerned - but also raises this relation to the role of <I>the </I>principle of 
decision, choice, and action. Briefly speaking, in the opposition between the 
good and the bad which direct moral conduct there is presupposed that in human 
acting the willing of any object occurs according to the principle of the truth 
about the good represented by these objects.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>8. THE COGNITIVE EXPERIENCE OF VALUES AS THE CONDITION OF CHOICE 
AND DECISION</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Motivation Leads the Will Out of Initial 
Indetermination</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The foregoing discussion seems to have thrown much light on the 
manner in which the object of will and the cognition of the corresponding object 
together form the dynamic schema of man's specific functioning. The will's own 
relation to truth - the relation that is decisive for the dynamic originality of 
every choice and decision making - has allowed us to argue away the form of 
determinism which has its source in the erroneous assumption that it is the 
object as cognitively presented that elicits the act of will. If such were the 
case, then motivation would amount to determination, and this would foil all the 
originality of choosing and decision making, and indirectly also of 
self-determination. Nevertheless, though the will's proper relation to the truth 
in action does not derive solely from the cognitive presentation of objects, it 
is distinctly influenced by it. Without being presented with objects the will 
would not be in a position to deliberate and select, and by a single fixating 
upon "simple decision" it could not develop its own relation to it. Motivation 
is not to be identified with determination, but it is the condition of 
autodetermination.</P>
<P align=justify>By "autodetermination" we mean the moment of freedom not only 
in the fundamental sense of the self-reliance of the person but also in the 
broader sense when it refers to the possible objects of willing. At the origin 
of this relation there is a certain indetermination, which, however, in no way 
implies an indifference to objects and to values; it rather means the readiness 
to direct our intention of will to any one out of the complete range available 
without any prejudical preference. Motivation serves to urge the will out of its 
initial, still undetermined state, though this is achieved not by its being a 
determining factor but by being the condition enabling autodetermination. It is 
this distinct trait of autodetermination in choice and decision that establishes 
their personal originality. As self-determination is both manifested in and made 
concrete by choice and decision, they reach right to the structures of 
self-governance and self-possession of the person. On these same structures also 
relies the transcendence that distinguishes the acting person from a mere 
individual.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Special Nature of Cognition as Condition of an Act of 
Will</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Knowledge appears then as the condition not only enabling but 
also influencing choice, decision making, and more generally the exercise (and 
mechanism) of self-determination; it is the one condition of the person's 
transcendence in the action. We have already seen how this transcendence springs 
from the relation to truth. Now, if this mode of transcendence is in its own way 
the essential moment of the will that manifests itself in every choice or 
decision making, then within the human person's dynamism as a whole this moment 
is in a specific way knit together with the relation to truth as the constituent 
of the cognitive structure. We see thus how cognition plays the role of one of 
the conditions of will. But at the same time we have to note the reciprocity of 
this exercise of the will. For the exercise of will, because of its own relation 
to the truth of all the objects to which it turns by means of its 
intentionality, or in other words, the intentionality of volition, also 
influences cognition. This influence does not amount to freedom to change "at 
will" the nature of the cognized or the processes of cognition and thinking; the 
will acknowledges objects as cognized but proposes to, and imposes specific 
tasks on, cognition and thought; the recognition and preference of these tasks 
are given in the deliberating moment of will to the truth about good. "To will," 
in virtue of its essential structure of recognizing truth with respect to its 
objects, comports essential structural extension in its foundational 
connectedness with the structures of "to cognize" and "to know," so that we are 
tempted at first to conclude that this dependence is one-sided without giving 
due attention to its effect, namely, that cognition is specifically influenced 
by the will's demand on it.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Moment of Truth about Good is Essential in the Experiencing 
of Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>This is how we may in the most general terms explain the basis 
in man for that branch of cognizing and knowing that we call "axiology," the 
knowledge of values.<SUP>50</SUP> For in the experience of value the moment of 
truth also seems to play an essential role. It is the truth about this or that 
object which crystallizes this or that moment of good. When for instance we 
experience the nutritive value of a food, we at once come to know what is the 
good of the object, which serves us as food. When we have the experience of the 
positive educative value of a book, we realize at the same time that the book as 
an object crystallizes a definite good. In either case our knowledge need not be 
provoked by, or serve, any concrete willing (though this would be the case if we 
were testing the value of a food in order to eat it, or inquiring about the 
educative value of a book in order to make use of it). The cognitive experience 
of value, that is to say, the apprehension of the good of this or that object, 
is not directly dependent on a concrete willing, though in principle it is very 
closely related to it. For the relation to truth then evolved in cognition is of 
such a kind that it may become the principle of willing when a choice or a 
decision is made. It is because of a definite value that we decide on an object 
of willing or choose among possible objects of willing. The cognitive experience 
of value is always an underlying factor in motivation.</P>
<P align=justify>The knowledge of values and its relation to the will can be, 
and usually is, considered as a separate problem in itself. The reason is the 
wealth of its various aspects. (In this chapter we still have to examine the 
emotional component in the experience of value.) In our study, however, there 
seems to be no place for its separate discussion, and indeed it would be 
fallacious to isolate the investigation of values from that of will. Perhaps 
another study will provide a better opportunity to go into it more fully.</P>
<P align=justify>At this point of our discussion the cognitive experience of 
value is of paramount importance for the understanding of the person, of his 
specific dynamism in action, and the transcendence that is strictly related to 
the moment of truth in acting. Summarizing the results of our discussion we 
might say that included in the experience of value there is the knowledge of the 
truth about the objects that the will turns to by the power of its specific 
intentionality. It is the intentionality of volition, this intentional willing, 
that because of the experience of value - that is to say, through the moment of 
the truth about the good that the willed objects constitute - assumes the form 
of deliberation, choice or decision making. The characteristic trait of the will 
is not the intentionality itself of willing (that is, its turning toward objects 
that are recognized as valuable) but the directing itself of the intention of 
the act of will, through deliberation, choice or decision toward its objective. 
This turning may be done exclusively by the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Axiological Truth and the So-called "Practical 
Truth"</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The moment of truth contained in the essence itself of choice 
or decision thus determines the dynamism of the person as such. It is the 
dynamism conductive toward the action. The moment of truth liberates the acting 
of the person and, in the deepest sense, determines the boundary between the 
acting and the submission to action or between the acting and the happening, in 
which the person may in different ways be the subject. Again, it is this moment 
that stays under the jurisdiction of the cognitive experience of value. Choice 
as well as decision making - each in its own way - is performed in reference to 
the truth of the object recognized as a positive good. Thus in both there is 
presupposed the <I>cognitive experience of truth; </I>for the cognitive 
experience to which the deliberation of the will takes recourse is not merely 
constitutive of objects of cognition but is first and foremost evaluating them 
with respect to that "truth" about the object which shows it as a positive or 
negative good. That is, we speak here about the axiological (or moral) truth, 
which is differentiated from the ontological and logical "truth." In grasping it 
we assert the value of an object rather than what the object itself or as 
cognized actually is. The "axiological truth" - or rather truth in the 
axiological sense - which is disclosed by our investigation is not, however, the 
same as the so-called "practical truth" and does not belong directly to 
so-called "practical knowledge." It is an essential element in the vision one 
has of human reality. It is also the factor that plays the most essential role 
in the structure of our acting to the degree that we may say that "to know" 
passes into "to will."</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=center>9. THE CREATIVE ROLE OF INTUITION IS UNDIMINISHED BY THE 
JUDGMENT OF VALUES</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Thought and the Efficacy of the Subject</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>So far in our analysis of knowledge as a condition of the 
person's transcendence in action we have concentrated on the content of 
cognition. But human cognition is a highly diversified and very complex function 
of the person and needs to be analyzed also from the side of the person in order 
to elucidate its share in the action and in the person's transcendence in 
connection with acting. The whole of human cognition is also contained within 
the limits of the experience, which in this study we are trying to interpret 
through the dynamism of man. As we have already pointed out, the characteristic 
mark of this dynamism is the distinction between acting and submitting to an 
impact. This distinction is also applicable, though in a specific manner, to 
cognition as a function of the person. Cognition is given us in experience 
essentially in the form of acting. Its proper moment consists in the fact that 
to cognize and also to think proceeds in sequences of acts; that is, it amounts 
to "act." Thinking, however, is a different function from cognizing. But 
alongside the active experience of cognition we also have the experience of 
thinking, which though of a more active nature has a cognitive significance. But 
if we consider the thinking process, at its already accomplished and thus 
passive stage, as the kind of experience in which thoughts just pass or flow 
"through" the field of actual consciousness - in such an experience it is the 
cognitive import accomplished already that belongs to the content of the flux; 
and the attitude of the human ego to it is that of the <I>passive </I>subject 
and not of the active agent. An experience of this kind is in a way analogous to 
the experience of "I want," when the psychical form of volition is by no means 
inherent in the personally efficacious "I will." This is the reason why we have 
asserted more than once that the intentionality of volition is in itself 
insufficient to constitute the dynamism of the will.</P>
<P align=justify>The difference between thinking and willing in general lies, 
broadly speaking, in their different directions: willing implies a certain 
outgoing toward an object and entering upon it as remaining external to the 
willing subject (the essence of willing being "to strive"), while thinking 
consists in first tending toward an object and then constituting it by 
introducing it within the immanence of the subject. Thus, for instance, the 
introduction of an object to the subject may be achieved by presentation in 
intuition of its noematic fragments in the object's "bodily selfhood" - or by 
means of imagination. But it may also be achieved by comprehension and 
interpretation. In each case the object is in a different way cognitively 
introduced to the cognizing subject; in the case of noematic self-presentation 
and imagination it is by means of direct intuition and in comprehension by means 
of the intellect.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>In Judgment Man Has the Experience of Himself as the Agent of 
Thought</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The direction simultaneously toward the object and backward to 
cognition (especially to the so-called "external perception") is also implied in 
experiences of the type when "thoughts" just pass through the mind. 
Nevertheless, even the experience of "immanent perception" of our cognitive 
acts, e.g., ln the perception "I am thinking," exhibits the cross currents of 
passiveness and the proper activeness of the personal ego. For on the one hand, 
we may consider that in certain of its processes thinking "happens" in man, but, 
on the other hand, in its other modalities it is - as Husserl has emphasized - 
active <I>par excellence. </I>It seems, however, that even "happening" itself is 
already a manifestation of the cognitive dynamism of man; thus there is also 
presupposed in it man's cognitive potentiality with all its complex 
implications. The passive mode of thinking seems to be radically differentiated 
from the active, however, on account of the role of judgment. Only with 
emergence within the schema of man's cognitive function of the instance of 
judgment has man the experience of being the agent of cognition and of thought. 
The action of judging seems to constitute the crucial and decisive factor of 
human cognitive activity. There is presupposed in it a still more elementary 
function of the mind, namely, that of ideation - an aspect strongly emphasized 
by contemporary thinkers. But experientially this function is inherent in the 
function of judging, and it is by judgment that in consciousness it manifests 
itself as the action, in which the ego is not merely the subject but also the 
agent.</P>
<P align=justify>The function of judgment has an "outer" structure on account of 
the objects that are its raw material. This structure becomes apparent in 
sentences expressed in speech or writing. For instance, in the sentence "The 
wall is white" the function of judging consists in attributing to a thing (the 
waIl) a property that it actually has (whiteness); this is expressed in the 
"outer" structure that appertains not only to speech but also to thought; for we 
speak in sentences because we think in judgments. But there is more in judgment 
than the outer structure; a judgment grasps a truth about the object that is its 
raw material. Thus in "the wall is white," in addition to the outer structure 
assumed by the function of judging on account of its object, there is also 
present the inherent, "inner" structure of this function expressing the grasping 
as such. That is, the function of judging establishes also the correctness of 
the way in which the "raw material" (or subject of the judging) is conceived by 
the predicate which is attributed to it in the judgment. It means that the 
judgment grasps this correctness of attribution as the "truth" of the object. To 
grasp the truth is the same as to introduce an object to the person-subject 
through one of his inherent properties. This property, which not only belongs to 
the subject as his self-transcendent, but also his experienced relation to 
truth, reveals at once the spiritual nature of the personal subject. Indeed, as 
we shall see in our subsequent analysis, truth is not only essential for the 
possibility of human knowledge, but it is simultaneously <I>the basis for the 
person's transcendence in the action. </I>For the moment of truth in this 
respect, or the truth about the moral good, makes of the action what it actually 
is; it is this moment that gives to the action the authentic form of the "act of 
the person."</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Correspondence of Judgment and Decision</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>There is a distinct correspondence or correlation between 
judgment and deliberation, choice or decision making in the process of the will. 
It is the correspondence of the already known to what becomes the object of 
willing. To apprehend properly this correspondence or correlation it is 
necessary, however, to approach and envisage the person in his transcendence. 
Through judgments the person attains his proper cognitive transcendence with 
respect to objects. But beyond the recognition of the correctness with which the 
attributes express the nature of objects, there is also a type of judgment in 
which the value is attributed to the subject, and the correctness of this 
attribution, grasped in the judgment itself (its <I>apodictic </I>aspect), 
constitutes "axiological" or "moral truth." The cognitive transcendence toward 
the object as known is the condition of the transcendence of the will in the 
action with respect to the object of the will. The judgment of values is 
presupposed in deliberation, in choice and decision, because it is not only 
preconstituted in and by itself through the truth about objects (the so-called 
"apodicticity" which we see as essential to judgment) but it also makes possible 
and lays a foundation for that proper relation of the will to objects. Whenever 
the person chooses or decides, he has had first to make a judgment of 
values.</P>
<P align=justify>It may be worth noting that every decision - and every choice 
seems to entail essentially a decision - comes as the nearest analogue of 
judgment, so much so that a judgment is often identified with decision. But the 
essence of <I>judging is cognitive and thus belongs to the sphere of knowing 
</I>while <I>the essence of decision is strictly connected with willing. </I>"To 
will" means not only to strive toward an end but also <I>to strive while 
deciding. </I>It is for this reason that the will is so deeply inherent in the 
structure of the person, and every authentic, wholehearted "I will" actualizes 
the proper self-governance and self-possession of the person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Creative Role of Intuition in the Discursive Perception of 
Values</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The prominence given here to the significance of judgment in 
the interplay of the object of cognition and that of will is not intended to 
belittle in any way the creative role of cognitive intuition, especially in what 
concerns the experience of values. We have pointed already to the cross currents 
of a certain passiveness and the proper activeness of the personal ego, which 
are apparent within the sphere of human thought. When judging, when formulating 
judgments, the ego has the experience of himself as the agent - the one who acts 
- of the act itself of cognizing. But we may also cognitively experience 
directly the value of the object of cognition. The subject - the ego -then 
remains as if absorbing this value, "contemplating" it and passive rather than 
active. It remains then in the passive role of the subject more than in that of 
the agent. These occasions are of extreme importance: they are creative and rich 
in consequences for cognition of human reality.</P>
<P align=justify>Although intuition seems at first sight only to happen in man 
we are not to belittle the active moment in its operation. First, it seems that 
the intuitive experience of objects is always accompanied by judgment; inasmuch 
as values are the object of intuition, it is a judgment of values, a judgment 
positing a given value. The character of this kind of judgment is not then 
discursive; the value is not reached in the course of a process of reasoning; 
instead, we find it in our knowledge as if it were ready-made rather than formed 
by reason. It is to this extent that we can speak of a kind of "cognitive 
experience." This experience is very often the outcome of earlier cognitive 
ventures, of those often countless intentional endeavors at grasping a value 
which, however, at the time failed in attaining its perception. When here and 
now we grasp a value intuitively, we have reason to suppose that this is an 
indirect result also of earlier repetitive efforts making up instances of a 
sequence.</P>
<P align=justify>Intuition and discourse are both involved, though in different 
ways, in the processes of cognition as a whole; sometimes it is intuition that 
lies at the origin of discursive thinking and sometimes it marks the end and is 
the indirect outcome of mental processes. From the point of view of the 
transcendence of the person the question, whether the cognitive process proceeds 
more intuitively or more discursively, has no major significance. The important 
thing is the moment of truth, for it is the relation to truth that explains all 
choice and decision. The intuition lying at the origin of a discursive process 
seems to indicate that the intuitive truth needs to be further exfoliated. 
Intuition that comes as the fruition of discursive processes, on the other hand, 
is like a retrieval of truth and somehow like abiding in truth. The person's 
transcendence in the action seems much more connected with the praxis - that is, 
the truth of the objective reality, in which man continuously strives to make 
right choices and decisions - than with the intellectual function of 
judging.</P></FONT>
