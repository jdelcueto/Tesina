<P align=center>1. </FONT><FONT face=Verdana>THE BASIC CONCEPTIONS AND 
DIFFERENTIATIONS</P>
<P align=center>OF HUMAN DYNAMISM</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>Introductory Remarks on the Relation of Dynamism to 
Consciousness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We now abandon the aspect of consciousness in order that we may 
understand better its functions through an analysis of the fact that man acts. 
The fact is given us first in the experience of "I act." Because of the 
experience we ourselves are placed, as it were, right inside this fact. 
Similarly, the fullness of an experience is inherent in our process of 
experiencing, and thus by analogy and generalization it is the basis for the 
formation of the human act. For every ego is a human being and every human being 
is this, that, or any other ego. Hence, when it is "you," "he," or "anybody 
else" who acts, their acting can be understood on the ground of experiencing our 
own acting, in "I act." The experience of acting is subjective in the sense that 
it keeps us within the limits of the concrete subjectivity of the acting human 
ego, without however obscuring the intersubjectivity that is needed for the 
understanding and interpretation of human acting.</P>
<P align=justify>The objectivation of the fact of "man-acts" requires an equally 
objective presentation of integral human dynamism.<SUP>26 </SUP>For this 
experiential fact occurs not in isolation but in the context of the entire human 
dynamism and in organic relation to it. The dynamism in question is the total 
dynamism that is present in the complete experience of man. Not everything 
belonging to the human dynamism is reflected in consciousness. For instance, 
practically nothing' of the vegetative dynamism of the human body is mirrored in 
consciousness. Similarly, not all the factors of the human dynamism may be 
consciously experienced by him. We already had the opportunity to mention 
briefly the disproportion between the totality of man's life and the scope or 
range of his experiences, and we shall return to the question to expound and 
complement it. At any rate, it is the conditions themselves of experience that 
seem to dictate in the analysis of the human dynamism the need to put aside at 
present the aspect of consciousness and the questions bearing only upon 
experiencing. It is not by accident that in the Introduction we discriminated 
the total experience of man from its various aspects, of which its inner aspect 
was even then seen as being closely connected with consciousness.</P>
<P align=justify>All the same, it is not only the dynamism proper to man that 
receives its basic reflection in consciousness; the human being is aware as well 
of the main trends in his dynamism, this awareness being connected also with his 
experiencing them. Indeed, he experiences acting and doing as something 
essentially different from the mere happening, that is to say, from what only 
takes place or goes on in him and in what he as man takes no active part. Having 
the experience of the two, objectively different structures - of the "man-acts" 
and the "something~happens-in-him" - together with their differentiation in the 
field of experience, provides the evidence, on the one hand, of the essential 
contiguity of man's consciousness with his being; on the other hand, the 
differentiation of experience gives each of these structures that innerness and 
subjectiveness which in general we owe to consciousness. At present, however, we 
are not interested in experiencing as such but in those structures which to be 
objectively differentiated require that we rely upon the total experience of man 
and not merely on the evidence which might be supplied by our consciousness. The 
immanent experience itself is insufficient with respect to all the processes, 
operations, events and states of the human body, all that pertains to the life 
of the organism. We always have to reach to other sources than the merely 
spontaneous and instantaneous evidence of consciousness itself and the 
experiences associated with it; we have to supplement it continuously from the 
outside in order to make our knowledge of man in this dimension as complete as 
possible.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Juxtaposition of "To Act" and "To Happen" as the 
Experiential Basis of Activeness and Passiveness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The two objective structures, "man-acts" and 
"something-happens-in-man," determine the two fundamental lines of the dynamism 
proper to man. Their directions are mutually opposite, so far as man's 
"activeness," that is to say, his acting, is visualized - and actualized -in 
one, while his certain passiveness, and passivity, are in the other. In each of 
these elemental lines of the dynamism proper to man the phenomenon or the 
content of visualization corresponds to the actual structure, and, conversely, 
each structure manifests itself as the phenomenon. The activeness and the 
passiveness visualized in either line are the constituents of the structures and 
the objective ground for their differentiation. The "activeness" in the 
"man-acts" structure is something different from the "passiveness" of the 
"something-happens-in-man" structure, the two being mutually opposite. In this 
opposition the whole structure, the one and the other, takes 
part.<SUP>27</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Just as we may consider "activeness" and "passiveness" to be 
not only mutually opposed but also conditioned and determined by each other, so 
we can draw a line separating what we do from what happens in us, though the 
things on either side of the line not only differ but also mutually account for 
themselves. This has the greatest importance for understanding the "man-acts" 
structure and subsequently for its possibly complete interpretation. We may say 
that man's actions and all that happens in him are not only mutually opposed but 
also distinctly correlated in the sense of a certain parity of both facts or 
both structures. For speaking of acting we say "man acts," and of what takes 
place in him we say it "happens in man," so that in either statement man stands 
as the dynamic subject. Man's actions just as much as the things that happen in 
him provide - all in their own way - the realization of the dynamism proper to 
the human being. Both have their source in man; and thus if in another aspect we 
speak of activeness and passiveness as of two different directions in the same 
dynamism, we thereby assert that the direction "from within" is common to both - 
the more so as it forms part of the essence of all dynamism. Though activeness 
and passiveness differentiate the dynamism they do not deprive it of the unity 
issuing out of the same dynamic subject; this, however, in no way alters the 
fact that action differs from the rest of the dynamic manifestations of the 
man-subject, the manifestations that are included in the category of 
passiveness.</P>
<P align=justify>It also seems necessary to call attention to two different 
forms of passiveness that are expressed in the propositions, "Something happens 
in man" and "Something happens with man." In ordinary speech these propositions 
may sometimes be used indiscriminately; often, in speaking of something 
happening with a person, we actually think of what takes place in him. Actually, 
when speaking of what happens with a person we refer to what the person 
undergoes from outside. This is an entirely different kind of passiveness. 
Rather than the dynamic subject, and the source of what occurs, man is then 
merely an object that only undergoes what another subject or even another force 
is doing with him. Undergoing as such refers to the passiveness of man, the 
subject, but says nothing, at least not directly, of the subject's inner 
dynamism, in particular nothing of the dynamism referred to in the proposition 
"Something happens in man."</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Potency and Act Conjugate as Conceptual Homologue of 
Dynamism</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the traditional approach to the person and to action the 
dynamism proper to man is interpreted by analogy to the dynamism of all beings. 
The dynamism of being is the subject of traditional metaphysics, and to 
metaphysics - in particular to its great founder, Aristotle - we owe the 
conception in which the dynamic nature of being is expressed in philosophical 
terms. This is not limited to the concept of "act" alone but includes the 
conjugate conceptual whole formed by the pair, potency and act. The dialectic - 
as we would say nowadays - conjugation of the pair makes them so essentially 
referring to each other that when pointing to one we at the same time indicate 
the other; for to grasp the correlated meaning of either, the understanding of 
the other is indispensable. It is for this reason that act cannot be understood 
apart from potency and vice versa.<SUP>28</SUP> The terms potency and act need 
little explanation. Potency, the Latin <I>potentia</I>, may be defined as a 
potentiality, as something that already is but also is not yet: as something 
that is in preparation, is available, and even ready at hand but is not actually 
fulfilled. The act, the Latin <I>actus</I>, is the actualization of 
potentiality, its fulfillment.</P>
<P align=justify>As is to be seen, the meanings of both concepts are strictly 
correlated and inhere in the conjugate they form rather than in each of them 
separately. Their conjugation reveals not only the differentiated, though 
mutually coincident states of existence, but also the transitions from one to 
the other. It is these transitions that objectivize the structure of all 
dynamism inherent in being, in being as such, which constitutes the proper 
subject of metaphysics, and at the same time in every and any being, regardless 
of the branch of human knowledge whose specific concern it constitutes. We may 
with justice say that at this point metaphysics appears as the intellectual soil 
wherein all the domains of knowledge have their roots. Indeed, we do not seem to 
have as yet any other conceptions and any other language which would adequately 
render the dynamic essence of change - of all change whatever occurring in any 
being - apart from those that we have been endowed with by the philosophy of 
potency and act. By means of this conception we can grasp and describe precisely 
any dynamism that occurs in any being. It is to them we also have to revert when 
discussing the dynamism proper to man.</P>
<P align=justify>The concept of the "act" - we may call it so, for short, once 
we keep in mind the correlate it implies - has primarily an existential 
significance. The two different states of being, to which correspond two 
different forms of existence, are not indicated solely by the two terms ~otency 
and act) essential to this conception. In addition, the transition from potency 
to act, termed <I>actualization, </I>is a transition in the order of existence; 
it indicates some sort of becoming, not in the absolute sense - this is possible 
only when something comes into being out of nonexistence - but in the relative 
sense, that is to say, becoming based on an already existing being and from 
within its inner structure. The dynamism of being is intrinsically connected 
with its very existence and is also the basis for, and the source of, all the 
structures that may be distinguished in it. Every actualization contains in 
itself both the possibility and the act, which is the real fulfillment of the 
possibility; hence it contains them not as two entities but as two interrelated 
forms of existence. Actualization always implies the following pattern of 
existences: what exists as a possibility may, because it thus exists, come into 
existence in an act; and conversely, what came into existence in the act did so 
because of its previous existence as potentiality. In actualization possibility 
and act constitute, as it were, the two moments or the two phases of concrete 
existence joined together in a dynamic unity. Moreover, the act does not signify 
solely that the state of fulfilled potentiality has ended; it also signifies the 
transition itself from potentiality to fulfillment, the very fulfillment. It now 
becomes evident that there is need of a factor that would allow this transition 
or fulfillment to be accomplished; this problem, however, we will not discuss at 
present.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Ambiguity of the Concept of "Act" and Differentiation of 
the Experiences of Acting and Happening</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Applying the conception of the act to the dynamism that is 
proper to man and constitutes the vital core of the dynamic conjugate of action 
and person, we have to assert at this stage of the discussion that it fits both 
essential forms of the human dynamism known from and by experience. The 
structure of "man-acts" as well as the structure of "something-happens-in-man" 
constitute the concrete manifestation of the dynamism proper to man. Some of 
their equivalence consists in man being present in either as its dynamic 
subject. The equivalence exists from the point of view of the human dynamism 
itself. From this viewpoint, having assumed the analogy of being, we may regard 
man's acting as well as what happens in him to be the fulfillment of a 
potentiality. The one and the other is an actualization, the dynamic unity of 
potentiality and act. This way of grasping the problem is justified by the 
general dynamism of man. It also enables us to search for and determine those 
potentialities which are inherent in man at the beginning of his various actings 
and of what we may perhaps call the various happenings, the different things 
that happen in him.</P>
<P align=justify>The difference of the activeness-passiveness type that occurs 
between the acting of man and the happening in man, the difference between 
dynamic acting and certain dynamic passiveness, cannot obscure or annul the 
human dynamism, which is inherent in one as well as in the other form. It does 
not obscure in the sense of the phenomenological experience and does not annul 
in the sense of the need of a realistic interpretation. Essentially, the human 
dynamism is interpreted by the concept of the "act." In this sense the term 
"act" adequately denotes the dynamic content of both structures: "manacts" and 
"something-happens-in-man." The question remains whether it is equally adequate 
to show the specific nature of action. To put the problem precisely we have to 
ask whether the word "act," while designating the dynamism of all being, as well 
as every human dynamism - activeness as well as passiveness - has also the 
capability of revealing the whole specific nature of action.</P></FONT><FONT

<P align=center>2. THE DEFINITION OF EFFICACY</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</FONT><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The Experience of 
Efficacy and the Differentiation of the Experiences of Acting and 
Happening</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>A distinction may be drawn between <I>human act </I>and <I>act 
of man. </I>In this way action is distinguished from all the other 
actualizations taking place in man <I>(act of man) </I>by means of the 
attributive <I>human. </I>It seems, however, that this distinction has a merely 
verbal significance and serves to accentuate rather than to explain the 
difference. For <I>human act, </I>or, equivalently, "human acting," is also an 
<I>act of man. </I>Hence, it is first necessary to demonstrate why and when the 
act of man is not human acting; for only then will it be possible to understand 
why human acting alone is the acting proper to man, that it alone corresponds to 
what actually is contained in the structure of "man-acts." We shall now endeavor 
to find such an explanation while adhering to our initial position as defined 
above.</P>
<P align=justify>Thus, the starting point in our argument will be the 
experiential difference that is discernible in the totality of man's dynamism 
between man's acting and what happens in man. An examination of the facts 
discloses that it is the moment of efficacy that determines this fundamental 
difference. In this case the moment of efficacy is to be understood as the 
having of the experience of "being the actor." This experience discriminates 
man's acting from everything that merely happens in him. It also explains the 
dynamic contraposition of facts and structures, in which activeness and 
passiveness are distinctly manifest. When acting I have the experience of myself 
as the agent responsible for this particular form of the dynamization of myself 
as the subject. When there is something happening in me, then the dynamism is 
imparted without the efficacious participation of my ego. This is precisely the 
reason why we speak of the facts of the latter kind as of something that happens 
in man, indicating thereby that then the dynamism is not accompanied by 
efficacy, by the efficacious participation of man. It is thus that in the 
dynanlism of man there appears the essential difference arising from having the 
experience of efficacy. On the one hand, there is that form of the human 
dynamism in which man himself is the agent, that is to say, he is the conscious 
cause of his own causation; this form we grasp by the expression, <I>"man acts." 
</I>On the other hand, there is that form of human dynamism in which man is not 
aware of his efficacy and does not experience it; this we express by "something 
happens in man."</P>
<P align=justify>The contraposition of acting and happening, of activeness and 
passiveness, brings forth still another contraposition that arises from having, 
or not having, the experience of efficacy. Objective efficacy is the correlate 
of the experience of efficacy, for having this experience opens to our insight 
the structure of the efficacious ego. But not having the experience of efficacy 
- when the ego does not efficaciously participate in all that only happens in 
man - is by no means equivalent to the absence of objective causation. When 
something happens, when an inner change takes place in man, it must have a 
cause. Experience, in particular the inner experience, only supplies the 
evidence that the ego is not the cause in the manner that it is in an action, in 
acting.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experience of Efficacy and the Causal Relation of Person 
and Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>We now see that the moment of efficacy, which is present in 
acting and absent in happening, does not at once explain what efficacy is, but 
only points to the specifically dynamic structure of human acting as well as of 
the one who acts. Having the experience of himself as the agent the actor 
discovers himself to be at the origin of his acting. It is upon him that the 
existence of acting as such depends: in him it has its origin, and he sustains 
its existence. To be the cause means to produce an effect and to sustain its 
existence, its becoming and its being. Man is thus in a wholly experiential way 
the cause of his acting. There is between person and action a sensibly 
experiential, causal relation, which brings the person, that is to say, every 
concrete human ego, to recognize his action to be the result of his efficacy; in 
this sense he must accept his actions as his own property and also, primarily 
because of their moral nature, as the domain of his responsibility. Both the 
responsibility and the sense of property invest with a special quality the 
causation itself and the efficacy itself of the acting person. The students of 
the problems of causality, on the one hand, and psychologists, on the other, 
often note that human acting is in fact the only complete experience of what has 
been called by Aristotle "efficient causation." Without going into the details 
of this thesis, we have at any rate to accept that part of it which asserts the 
special self-evidence of man's efficient causation in acting, the efficient 
causation of the acting person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experience of Efficacy and Man's Transcendence of His 
Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Efficacy itself as the relation of cause and effect leads us to 
the objective order of being and existence and is thus of an existential nature. 
In this case efficacy is simultaneously an experience. There lies the source of 
the specific empirical significance of human efficacy related with acting. For, 
as already mentioned, the efficacy of man draws him, on the one hand, into that 
form of his dynamism which consists in acting and, on the other, it allows him 
to remain above this dynamism and this acting. In the structure of "man-acts" we 
also have what may be defined as the immanence of man in his own acting and at 
the same time what has to be regarded as his transcendence relatively to this 
acting. The moment of efficacy, the experience of efficacy, brings forth first 
of all the transcendence of man relatively to his own acting. But then the 
transcendence proper to the experience had in being the agent of acting passes 
into the immanence of the experience of acting itself: when I act, I am wholly 
engaged in my acting, in that dynamization of the ego to which my own efficacy 
has contributed. The one could not be accomplished without the other. The 
"efficacious ego" and the "acting ego" each time form a dynamic synthesis and a 
dynamic unity in any particular action. It is the synthesis and unity of person 
and action.</P>
<P align=justify>This unity, however, neither obscures nor abolishes the 
differences. It is here that we come to the distinguishing trait in the 
structure of "man-acts," the trait that sets it off essentially from the 
structure of "some thing-happens-in-man." Being the agent, man is definitely the 
subject in his acting. When something happens, it is not man but the "something" 
that stands out as the agent while man remains as the passive subject. He 
experiences passively his own dynamism. What takes place in him cannot be, on 
the evidence of experience, defined as acting, even though it is still some sort 
of actualization of his own potentiality. The term "act" is not as strictly 
exfoliated phenomenologically as is <I>acting </I>or even <I>action. </I>Its 
reference is not to any actualization, to any dynamization of the subject that 
is man, but only to that actualization or dynamism in which man is active as the 
ego: the man who is the ego has the experience of himself, as the agent. 
According to the evidence of the integral experience it is then, and only then, 
that man performs an action.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Experience of Efficacy and the Differentiation of Action 
out of Various Activations</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Every dynamization of man in which he is not active as the 
concrete ego - that is to say, he as the ego, does not have the experience of 
his efficacy - we shall call <I>activation. </I>There is activation whenever 
something happens only in man and the something that happens is derived from the 
inner dynamism of man himself. But now the mode of the inner derivation is 
different from that which man does, in what is his action. The term 
<I>activation </I>seems to combine most adequately the moment of certain 
passiveness with the moment of activity, of certain activeness or, at any rate, 
actualization. The word is much used in natural science, but does not seem to 
have been applied in the study of the human being, in spite of its apparent 
adequacy for defining, and in a way even for explaining, the difference existing 
between the fact that man acts and the fact that something happens in him. 
Moreover, being rooted in everyday speech it expresses well the semantic 
difference and even contraposition between it and action.</P>
<P align=justify>By now the dynamism proper to man seems to have been 
sufficiently explained in the first approach. This first approach has dealt with 
the experiential differentiation of the human dynamism by the facts of acting 
and the facts of happening, which take place in the human being. In addition, in 
the first experiential approach we have already been able to discern within the 
structure of "man-acts" all the specificity of the conjugate of person and 
action. It has been brought into view by the moment of efficacy, which is 
simultaneously the moment of the transcendence of the person with regard to his 
acting. As the person-action conjugate occurs owing to this moment of 
transcendence we shall now consider it separately for a thorough 
analysis.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Man "Creates" Himself in Action: the Roots of Human 
</I>Ethos</P></b>
<P align=justify>Efficacy and transcendence bring with them a special dependence 
of acting upon the person. Man is not only the agent of his acting, he is also 
the creator of it. It lies in the essence of efficacy that it produces and 
maintains the existence of an effect. On the other hand, the essence of 
creativeness is to shape the created work. In a sense, acting is also a work 
created by man. This characteristic trait of acting is specifically evidenced by 
morality as one of its properties (and which we have frequently referred to in 
this study). Morality and acting differ essentially, but at the same time they 
are so strictly united with each other that morality has no real existence apart 
from human acting, apart from actions. Their essential separateness does not 
obscure their existential relationship. The one and the other are most strictly 
related with the efficacy of the person, indeed, with the phenomenon of the 
experience had of efficacy. (At this point phenomenology seems to infringe 
boldly upon metaphysics, and it is here that its reliance upon metaphysics is 
most needed; for phenomena themselves can visualize a thing clearly enough, but 
they are incapable of a sufficient explanation of themselves.)</P>
<P align=justify>If it is in acting that man forms his own moral value - wherein 
is contained an element of the specifically human creativity - then this 
additionally confirms that man, the actor, himself shapes his acting and his 
actions.~ The old Aristotelian problem, whether actions are the products of the 
acting man or the product is solely the outward effect of his acting - for 
instance, whether the product is the sheet of paper covered with writing or the 
strategic plan worked out by the mind - supplies sufficient evidence that human 
efficacy is also creative. Its creativeness uses man himself as its raw 
material. In the first plan, the human being forms himself by his acting. In the 
contraposition of man as "creator" and man as the "raw material" we again 
discover a form, or rather an aspect, of the contrast between activeness and 
passiveness, which we have been tracing here from the start. Indeed, it is a new 
aspect rather than a new form; for we cannot simply and definitely identify man 
as the "creator" with human acting, and man as the "raw material" with what 
happens in the human subject. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that 
action always consists in overcoming human passiveness in one way or 
another.</P>
<P align=justify>The moment of creativeness, which closely accompanies the 
moment of efficacy, the experience of efficacy that sets up the objective 
structure of "man-acts," brings out even more vividly the dominant role of 
efficacy in the integral dynamism of the human being. Efficacy itself is 
dynamic: indeed it constitutes, as it were, the culmination of the dynamism of 
the human being. But, at the same time, it distinctly differs from this dynamism 
as a whole. The difference between them has to be adequately emphasized by their 
interpretation.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>The Differentiation between Acting and Happening Contrasts 
Efficacy with Subjectiveness in Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>An analysis of the dynamic entity "man-acts" must account for 
both "man" and "acting" as the two constitutive elements of a whole. What is the 
man who acts, and what is he when he acts? That is the question which we must 
now consider. Man is the subject of his actions - this assertion is often made 
and as a rule is accepted without reservations. But what does "subject" really 
mean?</P>
<P align=justify>Following the line of our argument we reach the conclusion that 
within the integral experience of man, especially with reference to its inner 
aspect, we can trace a differentiation and even ~omething like a contrast of 
subjectiveness and efficacy. Man has the experience of himself as the subject 
when something is happening in him; when, on the other hand, he is acting, he 
has the experience of himself as the "actor," this difference having been 
already emphasized in our discussion. To the experiences thus had corresponds a 
fully experiential reality. Subjectiveness is seen as structurally related to 
what happens in man, and efficacy as structurally related to his acting. When I 
act, the ego is the cause that dynamizes the subject. It is the attitude of the 
ego that is then dominant, whereas subjectiveness seems to be indicating 
something opposite - it shows the ego as if it were subjacent in the fact of its 
own dynamization. Such is the case when something happens within the ego. 
Efficacy and subjectiveness seem to split the field of human experiences into 
two mutually irreducible factors. Experiences are associated with structures. 
The structure of "manacts" and the structure of "something-happens-in-man" seem 
to divide the human being as if they were two separate levels. The two levels 
will turn up on various occasions in the course of our further analyses.</P>
<P align=justify>For all the sharpness and distinctness - especially in the 
inner aspects of experience - of the differentiation and the contrast, it is 
impossible to deny that he who acts is simultaneously the one in whom something 
or other happens. Similarly, it is impossible to question the unity and the 
identity of man at the roots of acting and happening. Neither is it possible to 
question his unity and identity at the roots of the efficacy and the 
subjectiveness structurally contained in the acting and the happening that occur 
in man. For the human being is, as already stated, a dynamic unity, so much so 
that in our earlier analyses we called him outright the dynamic subject. This 
designation is here regarded as valid. Man's acting and that human efficacy 
which constitutes it experientially, as well as all that happens in him, combine 
together as if they issued from a common root. For it is the human being, as the 
dynamic subject, who is their origin. Speaking of the subject we simultaneously 
refer to subjectiveness. Subjectiveness has here a different sense from the 
subjectiveness we discovered in the experience of something happening in man 
when we contrasted the experience (and its corresponding structure) with acting 
and the efficacy contained in it. On that plane subjectiveness and efficacy 
appeared to be mutually irreducible, while now they can both be comprised by 
subjectiveness in its distinctive aspects. For, as is shown time and again by 
experience, they both spring from it.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>How the Subject is an Ontological Basis of Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>However we analyze the structure, conditions, and source of 
action we cannot bypass its ultimate ontological foundation. The subjectiveness 
present both in man's acting and in what happens in him, implies or refers to an 
ontologically subsequent factor as its necessary condition. Of course, in 
principle, man "underlies" all his actions and everything that happens in him 
insofar as they are but his manifestations. And yet we still need to 
differentiate in man a structural ontological nucleus that would account for the 
fact itself of man being the subject or the fact that the subject is a being. It 
is in the subject as a being that every dynamic structure is rooted, every 
acting and happening. It is given as a real, actually existing, being, the 
man-being that actually exists and hence also "really" acts. There is, indeed, 
between existence and acting a strict relationship. This relationship seems to 
be the basic datum of man's cognition upon which evidence his most elementary 
vital existence relies. Philosophically we may interpret this state of affairs 
by an assessment that "for something to act, it must first exist." However, let 
us not forget that action is an enactment of existence or actual being. And yet 
it seems that in the perspective of our investigations existence lies at the 
origin itself of acting just as it lies at the origin itself of everything that 
happens in man - it lies at the origin of all the dynamism proper to man.</P>
<P align=justify>Existence (or actual being) has to be differentiated, however, 
from its structural (ontological) foundation. It is only its derived 
constitutive aspect, and yet it is of immense importance. For if the "something" 
did not exist, then it could not be the origin and the subject of the dynamism 
which proceeds from its being, of the acting and the happening. If man were not 
to exist, then he would not actually act nor would anything actually happen in 
him. Considered as such a fundamental condition of the actual existence of every 
existing being, it may be said that this structural/ontological basis is itself 
a being insofar as it is the subject of existing and acting. Coming into 
existence may, indeed, be seen as the first act of every being, that is, the 
first and fundamental factor establishing its dynamism.~ The entire dynamism of 
man's functioning which consists in the acting of, and happening in, the dynamic 
subject simultaneously proceeds from (1,ut also enacts) the initial dynamism due 
to which a being exists at all.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Man's Ontological Foundation of Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the first and fundamental approach the man-person has to be 
somewhat identified with its basic ontological structure. The person is a 
concrete man, the <I>individua substantia </I>of the classical Boethian 
definition. The concrete is in a way tantamount to the unique, or at any rate, 
to the individualized. The concept of the "person" is broader and more 
comprehensive than the concept of the "individual," just as the person is more 
than individualized nature. The person would be an individual whose nature is 
rational - according to Boethius' full definition <I>persona est rationalis 
naturae individua sub -stantia.<SUP>31 </I></SUP>Nevertheless, in our 
perspective it seems clear that neither the concept of the "rational nature" nor 
that of its individualization seems to express fully the specific completeness 
expressed by the concept of the person. The completeness we are speaking of here 
seems to be something that is unique in a very special sense rather than 
concrete. In everyday use we may substitute for a person the straightforward 
"somebody." It serves as a perfect semantic epitome because of the immediate 
connotations it brings to mind - and with them the juxtaposition and contrast to 
"something." If the person were identified with its basic ontological structure, 
then it would at once become necessary to take account of the difference that 
distinguishes "somebody" and "something."</P>
<P align=justify>The person as such possesses, however, its own ontological 
structure, though one very different from all the others that surround the human 
being in the visible world. This difference, the proportion or rather the 
disproportion that is indicated in the words "somebody" and "something," reaches 
to the very roots of the being that is the subject. The fundamental dynamization 
of the being by existence and consequently also all the subsequent 
dynamizations, which are reflected by acting, operating, and the happening, also 
manifest the same difference, the same proportion with its inherent 
disproportion. The person, the human being as the person - seen in its 
ontological basic structure - is the subject of both existence and acting, 
though it is important to note that the existence proper to him is <I>personal 
</I>and not merely individual - unlike that of an ontologic ally founded merely 
individual type of being. Consequently, the action - whereby is meant all the 
dynamism of man including his acting as well as what happens in him - is also 
personal. The person is identifiable with an ontological basic structure in 
which a provision is to be made: the ontological structure of "somebody" 
manifests not only its similarities to but also its differences and detachment 
from the ontological structure of "something."</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Differences between Efficacy and Subjectiveness and Their 
Synthesis</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Once we reach the insight into the man-person as the 
ontological basis for existence, we can see in him a synthesis of those 
experiences and those dynamic structures which we have distinguished in this 
chapter. The two structures, that in which man acts and that in which something 
happens in man, cut across the phenomenological field of experience, but they 
join and unite together in the metaphysical field. Their synthesis is the 
man-person, and we discover the ultimate subject of the synthesis in its 
ontological groundwork. Not only does this groundwork underlie the whole 
dynamism of the man-person, but it itself is also the dynamic source of the 
dynamism. The dynamism derived from the actual existence has as its consequence 
the dynamism pertaining to activity.</P>
<P align=justify>The synthesis of acting and happening, which takes place on the 
ground of the human basic structure, is indirectly also a synthesis of the 
efficacy proper to acting with the subjectiveness pertaining to all that takes 
place in man. Ultimately, the synthesis not only has its foundation but also 
occurs actually through the mechanism of the basic ontological structure, that 
is to say, in the ontic subject. This is the reason why the human being, even 
while he is the agent in acting, still remains its subject. He is both the actor 
and the subject, and he has the experience of himself both as actor and as 
subject, though the experience had of his efficacy is overshadowed by the 
experience of his subjectiveness. On the other hand, if something only happens 
in man, then we have the experience of subjectiveness alone; in this case 
efficacy is not experienced, for then the human being as the person is not the 
agent.</P>
<P align=justify>The difference in these experiences and structures is in no way 
diminished by the fact of the synthesis of efficacy with subjectiveness, which 
reduces them to the structural support alone. Indeed, the dynamism proper to man 
cannot be adequately interpreted and fully understood without this difference, 
and thus it will have to turn up time and again in the course of our 
considerations. The structural nucleus functions as the subject, which means 
that it is simultaneously both the basis and the source of the two different 
forms of dynamism. It is in this that is rooted and from this that springs forth 
not only the dynamism of what happens in man, but also the total dynamism of 
acting with that conscious efficacy which is constitutive of it. The unity of 
the human structural nucleus can in no way obscure the deep differences that 
make the actual wealth of the human dynamism.</P></FONT><FONT face=Verdana>

<P align=center>4 THE PERSON AND NATURE: THEIR OPPOSITION OR 
INTEGRATION?</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>The Significance of the Problem</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The discussion of the ontological basis of man-person has 
brought us definitely to the analysis of the subject of acting. We shall now 
have to proceed with this analysis even further, in order to uncover, so to 
speak, the most deeply hidden roots of the dynamism of man, and more 
particularly the roots of efficacy, for it is efficacy that is the key for the 
understanding of the person-action relation. Man as the subject of acting and 
the acting of the subject are the two correlated limbs in our discussion, and 
each has to be cognized and cognitively deepened by means of the other. It may 
seem that when we identify the person with its structural nucleus - evidently, 
by applying the analogy of proportion - we regard as already definitely settled 
the place that in our analysis of the subject of acting we intend to assign to 
nature. However, the person and with it its ontological foundation have here 
been conceived not only as the metaphysical subject of the existence and the 
dynamism of the human being, but also as, in a way, a phenomenological synthesis 
of efficacy and subjectiveness. Thus <I>nature </I>has to assume to some extent 
a double sense, a point which we now intend to examine.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Nature Defines the Subjective Basis of Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Etymologically the term "nature" is, as we know, derived from 
the Latin verb <I>nascor </I>("to be born"), hence <I>natus </I>("born") and 
<I>naturus </I>("about to be born"). Thus "nature" denotes literally everything 
that is going to be born or is contained in the fact itself of birth as its 
possible consequence. Accordingly, the corresponding adjectives of the natural 
are <I>inborn, </I>an Anglo-Saxon word, and <I>innate, </I>a word of Latin 
etymology. <I>Nature </I>in its substantive use has many senses: it may refer to 
the material world with all its phenomena, whether animate or inanimate, though 
in the latter case it goes beyond its etymological source, which relates it to 
birth; as this is possible only in living creatures inanimate nature is in a way 
a contradiction in terms; it may also be used with an attributive limiting its 
meaning when we speak, for instance, of human nature, of animal or vegetative 
nature, and even of the nature of a concrete person, who may be good or bad 
natured. In all these uses the noun <I>nature </I>seems to point to some 
property of a specific subject, to something we may also call its essence. 
Occasionally, the two words are used almost interchangeably - for instance, we 
may speak of the nature or the essence of a thing - though their meanings never 
exactly overlap. Speaking of essence we refer to a different thing than when 
speaking of nature.</P>
<P align=justify>Nature does not denote a real and actual subject of existing 
and acting; it is not to be identified with the ontological foundation of a 
being. It can only apply to an abstract subject. For instance, in speaking of 
human nature we refer to something which has the status of real existence as the 
ontological structure of man only in an actual human being, but which has no 
real existence apart from him. Nevertheless, if we, so to speak, prescind from 
the nature of every human being, in whom it actually exists, then we may 
conceive it as an abstract being, which stands in relation to all men. In this 
way human nature directly points to what is the specific trait common to all 
human beings by the very fact of their being humans, and indirectly also to 
those to whom it belongs, that is, to the human beings themselves. It is at this 
point that, semantically speaking, nature comes nearest to essence, for it is 
here that it refers to what is specific to man as such, that is, points to what 
is essentially human, what makes man to be nothing or nobody but man.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Nature Determines the Manner of Acting</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Taken semantically, nature, conformably with its etymology, 
also reaches in another direction. It is not confined to the domain of the 
subject of acting, which to some extent we have already explored, but also 
signifies the manner of acting open to it. Without going into the problem of the 
manner of acting specific to nature as such we have first to look closer at the 
orientation itself of nature in the direction of acting or, more broadly, in the 
direction of dynamism. Nature; because of its etymology and the close 
resemblance to the Latin participle that it is derived from, tells of what is 
about to be born and what is contained in the fact of birth itself as its 
possible consequence. The fact of birth is in itself something dynamic; but it 
also marks the beginning of the dynamism proper to the subject that is being 
born. Birth is also the beginning of existence - it contains the initial and 
basic dynamization caused by existence, from which will issue all the subsequent 
dynamism of functioning. Hence, in the case of man the consequence of birth 
would be the whole synthesis of acting and happening which we have been tracing 
in this chapter. Is it nature that lies at the basis of this synthesis? If so, 
it would have to be either identical or very closely integrated with the human 
ontological nucleus. Or is it that nature only points to a certain domain of the 
human dynamism, to a definite form of actualization? Then it would be possible 
to attribute to it and deduce from it only a certain mode of acting rather than 
all human acting.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Why the Antagonistic Conception of Nature and 
Person?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is the latter understanding of nature that seems to result 
from the phenomenological reduction. By phenomenological reduction we mean the 
moment of the fullest and simultaneously the most essence-centered visualization 
of a given object. Assuming man to be a specific dynamic whole we may rightly 
regard as the moment of the complete and the most essential manifestation of 
nature the moment when something happens in man rather than that of his acting; 
the moment of what we have called activation rather than that of action; the 
moment of subjectiveness rather than that of efficacy. Why so? Because the 
concept of nature includes that dynamism which is directly and solely the 
consequence of birth itself; the dynamism that is exclusively inborn or innate, 
exclusively immanent in the given subject of acting, as if it was determined in 
advance by its properties. Nature reveals the dynamism of the subject, that is, 
it reveals that activeness which is wholly and entirely contained in the 
subject's dynamic readiness; as if this activeness was from the start an 
attribute of the subject and was entirely prepared in its subjective dynamic 
structure. This activeness does not rely on efficacy in the sense that efficacy 
occurs in every action or in the structure of "man-acts" where it takes the form 
of a certain predominance or transcendence of the acting subject in relation to 
the dynamization itself of the subject.</P>
<P align=justify>When so conceived nature presents itself as a strictly defined 
moment of the dynamism proper to man rather than as the basis of all this 
dynamism. It is manifested solely in the activation of the man-subject, while 
actions show him to be a person. While contained in actions efficacy brings into 
view a concrete ego as the self-conscious cause of action. It is this that is 
the person. So conceived, the person would differ from the nature in man and 
would even be in a way its opposite. As can be seen, this differentiation and 
this opposition comes after the first experiential differentiation; that is, the 
differentiation and the opposition between, on the one hand, the experiences and 
structures of man's acting and, on the other, those referring to what happens in 
man. This separation of experiences and structures would divide the human being, 
as it were, into two worlds: the world of the person and the world of nature. 
Emphasizing some moments in experience we may miss and disregard the transition 
between man's nature and his person, and we may fail to grasp their integrity. 
Let us note, however, that person and nature would then denote practically 
nothing more than a certain mode of acting and hence also a certain form of the 
dynamism proper to man, but would not in any significant way denote the subject 
of this dynamism and acting; indeed, they would almost completely disregard 
it.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Why the Integrated Conception of Nature in Person?</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>There seems to be in that approach a kind of transposition that 
puts the aspects of experience above its total significance. The total 
experience, which gives both a simple and fundamental perception of the human 
being - whether it be in the pre- and even nonscientific approach, or in the 
domains of learning, especially philosophy -supplies the evidence for the unity 
and the identity of the man-subject. This is accompanied by the synthesis, on 
the ground of the one and the same ontological support, of acting and happening 
that takes place in man, the synthesis of actions and activations, of efficacy 
and subjectiveness. There is, therefore, no valid reason for the mutual 
opposition in man of person and nature; on the contrary, we now see the need of 
their integration. From the particular moments or aspects of experience we have 
to pass to the whole and from the particular moments or aspects of man as the 
subject of experience to the total conception of man. (In the course of an 
actual cognitive process there is no such passing from one to the other and no 
such lines of cognizing: all the moments and aspects are firmly embedded in the 
cognitive whole. Nevertheless, we may here consider both the passage itself and 
the lines followed in it, in order to base our knowledge on firmer grounds. 
Another important aim is to show how phenomenology and metaphysics both 
scrutinize the same object, and that phenomenological and metaphysical 
reductions are not mutually contradictory.)</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Verdana>
<P align=center>5. NATURE AS THE BASIS FOR THE DYNAMIC COHESION OF THE 
PERSON</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>Efficacy of the Person and Causality of Nature</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>How is the integration of nature in the person accomplished? 
The answer was already indicated in the analysis of the mutual relation of the 
internally differentiated human dynamism to its ontological basis. When viewed 
from the standpoint of the ontological nucleus of the human structure the 
difference and the opposition between acting and happening, between the efficacy 
proper to acting and the subjectiveness proper to happening, to what takes place 
in man, must yield to the obvious unity and identity of the human being. For it 
is man who acts. And though, even if he - who is the personal "somebody" - does 
not act when there is something happening in him, the whole dynamism of 
activations belongs to him just as much as does the dynamism of actions. It is 
in man, the personal "somebody," that the activations that happen in him have 
their origin just as much as it is from him that spring the actions he as the 
actor performs.</P>
<P align=justify>Man's experience culminates in the experience of his ego. It is 
the ego that is the agent of actions. When man acts, the ego has the experience 
of its own efficacy in action. When, on the other hand, there is something 
happening in man, then the ego does not experience its own efficacy and is not 
the actor, but it does have the experience of the inner identity of itself with 
what is happening and, at the same time, of the exclusive dependence of what is 
happening upon itself. What takes place in myself in the form of various 
activations is the property of my ego and, what is more, it issues from nly ego, 
which is its only appropriate substratum and cause, though then I have no 
experience of my causality, of my efficacious participation, as I have in 
actions. Any attempt, however, to attribute what is happening in myself - to 
attribute this activation - to any other cause but myself would be immediately 
contradicted by experience. The human experience had at the crucial point where 
man experiences his own ego leads us directly and definitely to the conclusion 
that everything taking place in the human being appertains to the ego as the 
dynamic subject. This appurtenance includes also the causal relation, which 
though different in activations than in actions is still experiential and real. 
To put in doubt this appurtenance or this causal relation is tantamount to 
contradicting the evidence of the experience we have of our own self, of the 
experience had of the unity of the ego and its dynamic identity not only with 
all that man does but also with everything that happens in him.</P>
<P align=justify>These considerations have already brought us on the road 
leading to integration, regardless of whether or not we keep to the basic 
distinction between nature and person. Even if <I>nature </I>is to be identified 
only with the moment of activation, as opposed to the moment of action, which 
reveals the person in the human being, then the former moment at any rate is not 
external to the unity and identity of the ego. The experience of the unity and 
identity of the ego is objectively precedent to and also more fundamental than 
the experiential separation of acting from happening, of the efficacy from the 
nonefficacy of the self. The experience of unity and identity extends into the 
other experience constituting thereby the experiential basis for the integration 
of nature in the person, in the structural center of its ontological foundation. 
In this way nature still denotes that form of dynamism as its derivative, which 
is different from that of the person. The integration does not abolish the 
differences in the manner the very structural core of a being is dynamized, but 
simply prevents any tendency to treat person and nature as two separate and 
independent subjects of acting. In this way nature, conceived as that unique 
type of support of being which is man and hence the person, still indicates its 
different causations. Are these causations non-personal? The personal causation 
is contained in having the experience of efficacy of the concrete ego - but only 
when man is acting. On the other hand, when there is something happening in man, 
efficacy is not experienced and consequently there is no causation that would be 
proper to the person. Nevertheless, for the causes underlying this form of the 
dynamization of the subjective ego we have also to look within the ego and not 
to the outside of it; for then nature itself would appear as the cause of the 
dynamism. Nature integrated in the unity of the specific structural nucleus, 
which is man, would then refer to and indicate a different causal basis of the 
subject than the person.</P>
<P align=justify>In this approach we attempt to distinguish nature from the 
person as clearly as this is possible.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Meaning of the "Priority" of Existence over 
Action</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The metaphysical reduction, on the other hand, leads to the 
full integration of nature in the person. Paying no heed to nature as a specific 
moment in the dynamization of the subject it considers nature, as a basic 
property of the acting subject, which in our case is the man-subject. In the 
metaphysical approach nature is identical with essence, and thus nature in man 
is the same as the whole of his <I>humanness, </I>though humanness that is 
dynamic rather than static -because conceived as the basis of all the dynamism 
proper to man. It is at this point that we touch upon the essential difference 
between the metaphysical and the previous, more or less phenomenological, 
conception of nature. Nature in the metaphysical sense is equivalent to the 
essence of any being, where essence is regarded as the basis for the dynamism of 
this being.</P>
<P align=justify>The first elementary understanding of the relation existing 
between action and an acting being is expressed above in the priority attributed 
to existence over action. We must now take a closer look at the meaning of this 
assertion. In the first place we note its existential significance, for it 
states that in order to act it is first necessary to exist. It also states that 
acting as such is different from existence as such; merely to act does not mean 
to be contributing or perpetuating the process of existence; it is not just its 
homogenetic continuation or extension. There is a real difference between the 
two manifestations of man, "man as existing" and "man acting," even though it is 
the same man who exists and who acts. When man acts, his acting also has a kind 
of derivative existence of its own. The existence of the acting depends indeed 
on the existence of man, and it is here that there lies the proper moment of 
their existential causalitY. The existence of acting flows from and is 
subsequent to the existence of man; it is its consequence or effect.</P>
<P align=justify>The existential relation between action and being with which we 
are here concerned allows us to clarify and grasp these relations not only in 
the order of existence. It also brings to light the relation between the acting 
process and the acting subject - in this case the man-subject - in their 
essential status. The statement that action is subsequent or follows existence 
is meant to indicate a specific cohesion of the acting process and the acting 
agent. This cohesion is impossible to express otherwise than by resorting to the 
conception of nature. For nature is none other than the basis of the essential 
cohesion of the one who acts (though the acting agent need not be human) with 
his acting. To put it more generally and more precisely, we may say nature 
provides the basis for the essential cohesion of the subject of dynamism with 
all the dynamism of the subject. The attributive <I>all </I>is important, 
because it allows us to reject once and for all that meaning of nature which 
exhibits it as only a moment and only one mode of the dynamization of the 
subject.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Personal Existence as the Basis of the Dynamic Cohesion of 
Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The cohesion considered here is confirmed in experience. When 
man is considered as the subject of dynamism the cohesion applies to both his 
acting and what is happening in him, to every one of his actions and to every 
one of his activations. It includes the efficacy experienced in action by a 
concrete ego and the subjectiveness itself of the ego in the case of activations 
when efficacy is not experienced. There is cohesion whenever an <I>action </I>is 
operated by, or proceeds from, the human being as its agent. It is based on 
human nature, that is, on the humanness pervading all the human dynamism and 
shaping it so that it becomes really huma~.</P>
<P align=justify>The experience of man's coherence with all his dynamism, with 
his acting as well as with what happens in him, allows us to understand how 
nature is integrated in the person. The integration could not consist solely in 
the individualization of nature by the person. The person is not merely an 
"individualized humanness"; it actually consists rather in the mode of 
individual being that pertains (from among all the types of existing beings) to 
mankind alone. This mod~ of being stems from the fact that the peculiar type of 
being proper to mankind is personal. The first and foremost dynamization of any 
being appears as being derived from its existence, from its actual being.</P>
<P align=justify>Dynamization by the personal being must lie at the roots of the 
integration of humanness by the person. At any rate, considering the 
experiential cohesion of the whole human functioning with his existence, we are 
led to accept that it is human nature that constitutes the appropriate basis for 
the cohesion of the man-subject - whatever kind of inner dynamism it has - with 
any of its dynamizations. Of course, nature as the basis of this dynamic 
cohesion really inheres in the subject, while the subject itself having personal 
existence is a person. Hence, every form of dynamization of the subject, every 
operation -whether it consists in acting or in happening, that is, in activation 
- if really related to humanness, to nature, must also be really personal. The 
integration of human nature, of humanness, in and by the person has as its 
consequence the integration of all the dynamism proper to man in the human 
person.<SUP>32</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Person as the Real Existence of Human Nature</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>At the same time it is important to stress that because of 
man's nature, because of his humanness, such integration is possible only in 
man. Humanness or human nature is equipped with the properties that enable a 
concrete human being to be a person: to be and to act as a person. Moreover, it 
prevents him from being and acting otherwise. As these properties will be 
discussed more fully below, they need be only briefly mentioned here. Even so we 
see clearly enough that the integration of nature by the person in the human 
being not only presupposes nature, presupposes humanness, but also derives from 
it its real constitution. Hence, no other nature has any real (that is, 
individual) existence as a person - for this pertains to man alone.</P>
<P align=justify>The element of nature, of humanness, introduced into the 
preceding analysis has enriched our knowledge and our understanding of the 
person as the existential ontological support and also as a living, always 
expanding, synthesis of the dynamism proper to man, the synthesis of actions 
with activations and thus of efficacy with subjectiveness. With this element the 
whole interpretation of the person-action relation confirms its human import. 
Acting and happening are both human insofar as they derive within the person 
from nature, from the humanness of man. It is the person itself that is human 
and so are its actions. The efficacy of the human ego pertaining to action 
reveals the transcendence of the person, without, however, separating the person 
from nature. It only indicates the special properties of nature; it indicates 
the forces that constitute the being and the acting of man at the level of the 
person.</P>

TO CONSCIOUSNESS</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>The Nature-Person Relation in the Potentiality of the Man 
-Subject</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The integration of nature in the person achieved by way of the 
metaphysical reduction brings to light the unity and the identity of man as a 
subjective being. The integration of humanness by the person, which is equally 
the integration of the person by humanness, does not however abolish in any way 
that difference between the person and nature which is manifest in the total 
experience of man, especially in its inner aspect. The fact of the unity and 
identity of the human being as the subject of the dynamism proper to him does 
not abolish in any way the fact of the difference between man's acting and all 
the things only happening in him, between action and the various activations. 
Neither does the integration of nature in the person abolish or in any way 
obscure the fact that man's personality is ascertained from his actions, that is 
to say, from his conscious acting, while everything else is contained in the 
person because of the identity and the unity of that subject which acts 
consciously and performs actions. "Personality" as here used means that man is a 
person. Man's being a person and the fact that this is manifested or visualized 
in his conscious acting as well as in his consciousness was discussed in the 
preceding chapter. We owe to consciousness and especially to its reflexive 
function, that man - the subjective autonomous being - has the experience of 
himself as the subject, which makes his being fully "subjective."</P>
<P align=justify>The difference between person and nature within the frame of 
the same ontological structure of man is obvious, even when we consider their 
metaphysical integration: if there were no distinctiveness, there would be no 
need to integrate. Humanness and personality (the fact of being a person) are 
two different things. In this study, where we are striving to arrive at the 
deepest possible understanding of the structure of man's acting, nature as 
humanness may be but another step in our analysis and comes in only as if it was 
its background. In the foreground there is nature as the ground of causation for 
the human ontological basis, and following it comes a certain form of 
dynamization of that ontological basis. In other words, we are interested in the 
relation of nature to the person from the viewpoint of the potentiality of the 
man-subject. We may even say that hitherto our whole analysis was indirectly an 
analysis of his potentiality.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Potentiality Indicates the Source of the Inner Dynamization of 
the Subject</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The reason for this last conclusion lies in the fact that we 
take note of the potentiality of the man-subject by ascertaining its dynamism. 
Either form of this dynamism - man's acting or action, and all that happens in 
him and that we have called "his activation" - issues from within and has its 
origin in the subject, which in our account we have rightly defined as dynamic. 
The dynamism of the subject is derived from his potentiality; for potentiality 
consists in having at one's disposal certain powers inherent in the subject. At 
this point, however, we have to define some of our terms. <I>Dynamism, 
</I>etymologically derived from the Greek <I>dynamis, </I>means force or power, 
while <I>potentiality, </I>derived from the Latin <I>potentia, </I>here denotes 
power or faculty. We thus see that etymologically the two terms are very closely 
related. But their application in the present discussion also shows the clearly 
marked differences between them. Thus <I>dynamism, </I>as we could see, refers 
primarily to that actual dynamization of the man-subject which issues from 
within and may have the form either of acting or of happening. <I>Potentiality, 
</I>on the other hand, denotes the source itself of this dynamization of the 
subject, the source that is inherent and that ceaselessly pulsates in the 
subject, and which comes to the surface in one or the other form of the 
subject's dynamization. In the traditional conception of man based on 
metaphysical premises this source is called "faculty"; a faculty is equivalent 
to the point where a force is focused, the center where power resides and is 
wielded.</P>
<P align=justify>We ascertain the potentiality of the man-subject while 
ascertaining his dynamism. Accordingly, our knowledge of it is in fact 
experiential: contained in either form of dynamism - whether acting or happening 
- there is also potentiality as the basis and as the source of the then existing 
dynamization. This basis is not, however, as apparent in experience as is the 
dynamization itself of the subject and the actual form of the dynamism. Our 
interpretation of it, that is, of the dynamic source of either form of the 
actual dynamism, rests on a reasoning that is strictly connected with the 
overall object of experience; far from being detached from the object, our 
reasoning goes deeper into the heart of the matter than when the dynamism in any 
of its forms is merely taken note of. When man acts and when anything happens in 
him, it is first of all this concrete form of the dynamization of the 
man-subject that is given us experientially, whereas its basis and its source 
are given us only indirectly, as if they came at secondhand; for experience 
clearly shows that this form of dynamism issues from within. But, while 
revealing the innerness of the source, experience must also show what is the 
source of the dynamization within the subject; it must point not just to the 
subject as a whole but to the particular, clearly defined dynamic source for one 
or other form of the dynamization of the subject. Without these well defined but 
varied sources it would be difficult to explain why the subject is dynamized in 
such different ways.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Different Basis of Activity and Passivity in the 
Potentiality of Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The most striking difference is that which occurs between the 
dynamization of the subject when man acts and when there is something happening 
in him. Underlying this difference in the dynamism of man there must be a 
different potentiality of the human ontological nucleus with its regulative 
organization. To grasp and define the specific nature in the structure of man's 
acting from the point of view of the subject's potentiality is one of the chief 
aims in this study. We advance toward this objective step by step, by analyzing 
the separate contents of both structures. The structure of something happening 
in man indicates a different basis for the potentiality of the man-subject than 
for the structure of man's acting. However we may venture to guess that if the 
difference in the forms of the dynamism itself is so striking, then there has to 
be a corresponding difference in the potentialities, which means that different 
faculties must lie at the dynamic roots of acting and happening, of action and 
activation.<SUP>33 </SUP>The problem was fully investigated by traditional 
philosophical anthropology (psychology), and as we are here striving to focus 
our attention on the person with all his specific dynamism, we will not follow 
the traditional path of discriminating between man's particular faculties as 
such. The road of tradition being well trodden and fully explored we must 
abandon it at this point. We shall instead follow the basic intuition of the 
person as it manifests itself in actions. Accordingly, in approaching the end of 
the analysis of this dynamism, which has already brought out the specific role 
of the efficacy of the personal ego in every action, we have now to turn again 
to our earlier discussion of consciousness. In doing so our aim is to develop a 
more precise conception of the relation of consciousness to potentiality in 
man.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of Consciousness to Psychoemotive 
Potentiality</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>With this purpose in view we are going to consider two very 
different kinds of both dynamism and potentiality, which may also be spoken of 
as two structural levels of the dynamic man-subject. They also constitute two 
levels of the subjectiveness of every concrete ego, because at these levels the 
ego has the experience of itself only as the subject and not as the actor, which 
it would have when acting consciously, that is, in actions. The two levels in 
the dynamism as well as in the potentiality of man are the psychoemotive and the 
somato-vegetative.</P>
<P align=justify>It is worth noting that we are always concerned with the 
relation of dynamism to potentiality, so far as the relation is visualized in 
the experience of man (and especially with reference to his inner aspect). It is 
in this aspect that, because of the different relation to consciousness, the 
vegetative dynamism and indirectly the vegetative potentiality differs in man 
from the emotive dynamism and also indirectly from the emotive potentiality. 
Consciousness in its mirroring function, and the reflexive consciousness that 
follows, is the condition of having a subjective experience, in this case of 
having the experience of what is happening in man. Thus we are not at present 
concerned with the objective difference between those acts and faculties as such 
which pertain to the somato-vegetative and the psychoemotive levels, but with 
what we may call their position in the reflecting of consciousness and in 
experience, and with the range of consciousness in these areas of man's 
potentiality. All this is not without significance for the complete image, in 
which we consider the man-person not only as an objective being who is the 
subject, but also in connection with the experience he has of the subjectiveness 
of his being and acting. These conditions are not without significance in the 
effort to understand the vegetative and emotive forms themselves of both the 
dynamism and the potentiality.</P>
<P align=justify>The difference between the two forms of the dynamism as well as 
between the two levels of man's potentiality manifests itself among others in 
our awareness of one but not of the other. This refers first of all to the 
character of the dynamism itself, that is to say, of the corresponding 
actualizations. The acts of the emotive sphere - or, in other words, that form 
of dynamism which in the subject is based on and springs from the psychoemotive 
potentiality - are clearly mirrored in consciousness. They have, if one may say 
so, their place in the field of consciousness, and they proceed in the subject 
as more or less distinct experiences. We may even say that not only are we aware 
of them, but that they are inherently accessible to consciousness, which means 
that consciousness must necessarily reflect them and include them as experiences 
in the inner profile of man's subjectiveness.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of Consciousness to Somato-Vegetative 
Potentiality</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The acts of the vegetative sphere - that sphere or form of the 
human dynamism which in the subject is based on and springs from the 
somato-vegetative potentiality - do not on the whole attain man's awareness, and 
they even seem to be inaccessible to consciousness. It is to be stressed that 
the somato-vegetative dynamism and its corresponding potentiality in the 
man-subject are connected with the human body so far as it constitutes the 
organism. The term "vegetative" is used here in a wider sense than when we 
speak, for instance, of the vegetative system in medicine. Its meaning 
corresponds approximately to the old Aristotelian idea of the vegetative soul. 
The somato-vegetative dynamism is that form of the dynamism proper to man which 
is vital to the human body as an actual organism and, moreover, so far as the 
organism conditions the various psychical functions.</P>
<P align=justify>The whole of this dynamism and consequently also its 
correspondmg potentiality seems to have an entirely different margin in the 
field of consciousness, one that is much more restricted and indirect than that 
of the psychoemotive dynamism. Man is aware of his body but as something that 
has its specific life. Having the awareness of the body leads indirectly to 
having the awareness of the organism. But the human being has no direct and 
detailed consciousness of his organism; he is not conscious of the particular 
dynamic instances of acts which compose the whole of the vegetative dynamism. 
These factual instances, these forms of the dynamism of the human subject, 
remain inaccessible to consciousness. They occur and develop spontaneously 
without the accompaniment of their being mirrored in consciousness. The dynamic 
facts, the actsof the somato-vegetative nature, are not included as experiences 
in the inner profile of the human subjectiveness. It is only by means of 
sensations that we can have the experience of anything that happens at this 
structural level of the human subject, a fact already mentioned in the preceding 
chapter. Accordingly, when we have, for instance, the experience of physical 
pain or physical well-being and fitness, then the nature of the experience is 
basically psychical and not vegetative, though its objective roots are on the 
somato-vegetative level, in the potentiality of this level.</P>
<P align=justify>The total experience of the body and the consciousness of the 
body seem to rely extensively on the sphere of sensations, the so-called bodily 
sensations. Since the significance of somato-vegetative and psychoemotive 
factors in the study of the acting person is indubitable, and since these 
questions deserve a fully detailed and comprehensive analysis, their discussion 
is deferred to a separate chapter.</P>

<P align=center>7. THE RELATION OF POTENTIALITY TO CONSCIOUSNESS EXPRESSED BY 
SUBCONSCIOUSNESS</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>Potentiality Comes before Consciousness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>Man who is the actor, who performs actions, is also the dynamic 
subject of everything that happens in him, whether the occurrences are at the 
emotive or the vegetative level and whether they are or are not accessible to 
consciousness.~ The subject is always one and the same; it is the subject that 
is all a person, a "somebody," and does not cease to be a person in the whole 
sphere of the causations of nature which, as already noted, differs from the 
causation of the person. The fact of the man-subject being a person is not 
altered by the activations that fashion the dynamism pertaining to the emotive 
sphere of man's integral existence. The unity and identity of the being who is 
the subject bear witness to the reality of the potential unity, and hence also 
to the dynamic unity of this subject. Its unity is not abolished by those 
structural differences which, for instance, are manifest in the relation of 
potentiality to consciousness and vice versa. We have already seen that 
consciousness does not reflect to the same degree the whole potentiality of the 
human being with its consequent dynamizations. The vegetative potentiality and 
dynamism of the human being both remain essentially inaccessible to 
consciousness; they are not registered in consciousness though they form part of 
the structure of the dynamic subject who is a person. Undeniably, vegetative 
potentiality constitutes a factor in countless instances of conscious human 
acting, in countless actions, which of course does not mean that vegetative 
potentiality itself is their source.</P>
<P align=justify>We now see that it is not owing to consciousness that the 
dynamic unity of the man-subject is achieved at the vegetative level. The unity 
is attained apart from and in a way outside of consciousness, which in its 
reflecting function is not instrumental in this respect; for, as we saw, dynamic 
unity is antecedent and primary to consciousness in both its mirroring and 
reflexive functions. In the man-subject it consists - at least at the somatic 
level - primarily in the unity of life and only secondarily and, as it were, 
accidentally in the unity of experience. This assertion supports the priority of 
potentiality with regard to consciousness. An analysis of the human being, of 
the acting person, if it were to be grounded on consciousness alone, would from 
the first be doomed to inadequacy.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Consciousness and the Delimitation of the Psychical and the 
Somatic</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The priority of potentiality with regard to consciousness has 
to be taken into account also at the emotive level, even though the role of 
consciousness at this level of the human dynamism is very distinct and very 
effective. All elements composing the emotive sphere of the human dynamism - the 
various sensations or emotions - are not only spontaneously recorded in 
consciousness but are also vividly experienced by man. The dividing line between 
these experiences and the great wealth and variety of data that belong to the 
somato-vegetative life and are not had in experience coincides to some extent 
with the line dividing the psychical from the somatic. Although the latter 
delimitation, which refers only to objective structures, is established 
according to different criteria, they are to some extent adopted from the 
criteria of the former division. This is basically permissible as long as the 
adoption is carried out on the right plane, which is important because otherwise 
confusion may result among the different aspects of experience, and consequently 
in the understanding of man - a confusion we must avoid. If the human being is a 
specific field of experiences and understandings then consciousness and 
experience, which help in obtaining a comprehensive grasp of this field 
primarily in the inner experience, cannot be interchanged with what determines 
the relations among the objective structures themselves. It is to such objective 
structures that the division of the psychical from the somatic, not to mention 
the soul and the body in man, seems to refer. Every one of these divisions has a 
different significance and issues from different premises, even though we may 
say they all have a common root where they meet.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Introducing Subconsciousness into the Analysis</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>So far our analysis has allowed us to distinguish in the 
totality of the human dynamism a sphere accessible to consciousness and another 
that remains inaccessible to it. Thereby the way is opened to introduce the 
factor of "subconsciousness." With reference to the same man-subject, who is a 
person, the dynamism accessible to consciousness is distinguishable from the 
dynamism inaccessible to it. We may even say that in a way they are opposed to 
each other, if the relation of the dynamism to consciousness is taken as the 
dividing criterion. But in the concept of subconsciousness there is more than 
just the inaccessibility to consciousness of the dynamic facts, of the 
activations that occur in the man-subject, especially at the somatovegetative 
level. The subconscious, as we know it from researches in psychoanalysis, 
designates a different source of the content of human experience than the source 
that feeds consciousness. Such is the case, for instance, with sexual objects in 
the treatment by Freud of the subconscious, and with other objects in the 
approach of Adler or Jung. Genetically, this content of human experience is 
connected with instincts, such as the sexual instinct or the ego instinct.</P>
<P align=justify>At a later stage of our discussion we shall deal with the 
problems of instinct and impulses in the whole structure of human dynamism. It 
is obvious, however, that these problems are of great significance in the 
present context, insofar as we are tempted to seek in the subconscious the 
potentiality of the human subject. Moreover, this tendency might lead us to 
attribute specific priority of potentiality with respect to conscious functions. 
We mean by that a priority concerning the structuring operations of the human 
mind and consequently priority in the terms of interpretation and hence of 
understanding: in point of fact, it seems that it would be impossible to 
understand and explain the human being, his dynamism as well as his conscious 
acting and actions, if we were to base our considerations on consciousness 
alone. In this respect, as it seems, potentiality of the subconscious comes 
first; it is primary and more indispensable than consciousness for the 
interpretation of human dynamism as well as for the interpretation of conscious 
acting. Consciousness stresses the subjective aspect of conscious acting and to 
some extent also of what happens in man, but it does not constitute the inner 
structure of the human dynamism itself.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Relation of Subconsciousness to the Dynamism and 
Potentiality of Man</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>All that has just been said is confirmed by subconsciousness in 
a specific manner, specific so far as the subconscious itself is primarily 
related to the inner aspect of human experience. Speaking of the subconscious we 
refer to, as it were, an inner space, to which some objects are expelled or 
withheld and prevented from reaching the threshold of consciousness. Both one 
and the other - the expulsion and the holding back - show that subconsciousness 
is also controlled by laws of a specific dynamism. This is evidenced by the 
threshold over which some elements must force their way before they can reach 
consciousness and enter into the process of experience; while remaining in 
subconsciousness they are beyond the flux of experience' or, to put it more 
accurately, they remain in a state of <I>subexperience. </I>What is it that 
keeps guard at the threshold of consciousness? Is it the task of consciousness 
itself or of still another factor ranking higher in man, namely, the will? The 
threshold of consciousness does not seem to be always closely guarded, and it is 
not always that the control or censorship by that dominant factor in man is 
exercised. The ordinary emergence into consciousness, the coming to awareness, 
takes place spontaneously and in an uncontrolled manner: for instance, when we 
feel pain in a bodily organ we become aware of its existence and of its 
malfunction. But in this case there is only transition from the nonconscious to 
the conscious. Psychoanalysts have, however, designated subconsciousness solely 
for the elements whose reaching the threshold of consciousness is associated 
with the exercise of the factor dominant in man, with the special vigilance of 
this factor.</P>
<P align=justify>Then, however, the consideration of subconsciousness allows us 
to see all the more clearly the dynamism and the potentiality in man; for it is 
indicative, on the one hand, of that dominant dynamism - and with it of that 
underlying dominant potentiality which keeps watch at the threshold of 
consciousness - and on the other, of that potentiality which in the man-subject 
stays below the level of consciousness or, at any rate, below the current 
threshold of consciousness. Indeed, the elements that have been expelled from 
consciousness - sometimes they are even called repressed - or prevented from 
reaching it, do not float in the void but obviously remain with the subject. 
They are, moreover, maintained in a dynamic condition, waiting to be carried 
over the threshold of consciousness. Psychoanalytical researches tell us that 
they are always waiting for a suitable opportunity to emerge:</P>
<P align=justify>for instance, when consciousness is weakened or inhibited by 
overwork or in sleep. Should we not conclude that these lower levels of human 
potentiality - that is, the vegetative and in a way also the emotive - assist, 
as it were, with their own dynamism rather than shelter the objects shut off 
from consciousness? But while the dynamism of the vegetative level remains 
almost entirely inaccessible to consciousness, the emotive dynamism, which will 
be more fully discussed below, seems very helpful in the psychical reproduction 
and vividness of various objects as well as of those that have been rejected by 
consciousness and the will.</P><I>
<P align=justify>Subconsciousness Shows Consciousness as the Sphere of Man's 
Self-realization</P></I>
<P align=justify>The remarks referring to subconsciousness are of special 
significance at this stage of our discussion when we are considering primarily 
the human being as the subject of acting and more generally as the subject of 
dynamism.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify>First, they clearly show the potentiality of the subject in the 
inner aspect itself.</P>
<P align=justify>Second, they help us to see at least to some extent, the inner 
continuity and cohesion of the subject; because it is seemingly subconsciousness 
that brings into view the transitions between, on the one hand, what only 
happens in man owing to the natural vegetative, and possibly also emotive 
activations and, on the other, what man consciously experiences and what he 
considers to be his actions. The continuity and cohesion exist within the frame 
of the subconscious, but they also span the gap between subconsciousness and 
consciousness. The threshold of consciousness not only divides the one from the 
other but it also connects them with each other.<SUP>35</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Third, subconsciousness, with its continuous relation to 
consciousness, allows us to see the human being as internally subjected to time 
and thus having his own internal history. This history is determined and formed 
to a great extent by factors in man's dynamic structure itself. Consciousness 
has often been compared with a stream of contents flowing continuously in the 
man-subject; by allowing us to better comprehend how this stream is related to 
the potentiality of the subject, subconsciousness shows indirectly where the 
springs to the histories of individual human beings are to be sought.~</P>
<P align=justify>Finally, in what is but a comment to the preceding point, we 
may say that subconsciousness brings out vividly the hierarchy of human 
potentialities. There is something highly significant in the constant drive 
toward the light of consciousness, in the constant urge emanating from the 
subconscious to attain the level of consciousness and to be consciously 
experienced. Hence both the existence of subconsciousness and the functions it 
performs indubitably indicate that consciousness is the sphere where man most 
appropriately fulfills himself. The subconscious is to a high degree shaped by 
consciousness, but otherwise it is only a repository where what is contained in 
the man-subject is stored and awaits to emerge in awareness. For it is then that 
it will also assume a fully human significance.</P>
<P align=justify>Let us add that the transfer to the domain of consciousness of 
moments captured in subconsciousness, and especially those hindered from coming 
to a genuine objectivization, stand out as one of the chief tasks of morality 
and education. This, however, is a problem that goes far beyond our present 
concern and will not be considered in this work.</P></FONT><FONT face=Verdana>

<P align=center>8. </FONT><FONT face=Verdana>MAN IN BECOMING: THE MANIFESTATION 
OF FREEDOM IN THE DYNAMISM OF THE MAN-SUBJECT</P></b>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>The Being-Acting-Becoming Relation</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>So far in the analysis of the dynamism proper to man we have 
tried first to identify and define its manifest differences and then to indicate 
what are the necessary relations between dynamism and potentiality in the 
man-subject. There is still another problem that we have to examine. Every form 
of the dynamism we find in man, whether it be acting, that is, action, or 
happening in its manifold forms here called activation, is also associated with 
a certain form of becoming of the man-subject. By "becoming" we mean such an 
aspect of the human dynamism - whether it is the aspect of man's acting or the 
aspect of what happens in him - that does not only center on man himself, the 
subject of this dynamism, insofar as it introduces or carries on a process of 
change. In point of fact, in all dynamizations the subject does not remain 
indifferent: not only does it participate in them, as demonstrated to some 
extent above, but it is itself in one way or another formed or transformed by 
them. (At this point we will touch upon the inner structure of the life-process 
itself.)</P>
<P align=justify>Thus our analysis brings us down again to the innermost 
dimension, the dimension we refer to when speaking of the concrete ontological 
nucleus of man. It is not a passive substratum but, on the contrary, the first 
and fundamental level for the dynamization of the being that is the personal 
subject; it is a dynamization by the process of existence itself - by the very 
fact of existence. It is to this that in the ultimate analysis we have to refer 
all becoming, the entire becoming process occurring in the already existing 
man-subject. Indeed, to come into existence is as much as to become. The 
initial, original dynamization of the individual being as such is simultaneously 
the first instance of becoming of the human being, his coming into existence. 
All subsequent dynamizations due to any form whatever of the becoming process do 
play the role of maintaining in existence the already originated being. 
Nevertheless, in each subsequent dynamization something begins to exist in the 
man-subject that already is. In metaphysical terms, such coming into existence 
is accidental relatively to that original coming into existence which 
constitutes the being itself. Having come substantially into existence, man 
changes one way or another with all his actions and with all that happens in 
him: both these forms of the dynamism proper to him make <I>something </I>of him 
and at the same time they, so to speak, make <I>somebody </I>of him. An analysis 
of the human dynamism ought to exfoliate this becoming. In the metaphysical 
analysis it is this aspect that is first of all brought into prominence. It is 
only indirectly that the act as such tells us of man's acting or of what happens 
in him, but it very adequately indicates any definite instance of change, 
transformation - that is, of becoming - of the man-subject himself or of his 
faculties.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>The Subject's Differentiated Potentiality and the Corresponding 
Spheres of Man's Becoming and Development</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>In the present analysis the question of the becoming of man 
comes to the fore, the becoming that is referring to the whole human dynamism. 
As it may be easily seen, every form of the dynamism is in some way more or less 
directly connected with a different form of becoming; the becoming of man is 
internally differentiated and depends on the form of the dynamism that 
contributes to the whole process of becoming as well as on the potentiality on 
which the dynamism is grounded. At an earlier stage of the discussion a line was 
drawn dividing the somato-vegetative from the psychoemotive dynamism and at the 
same time separating the two levels of the potentiality proper to the human 
subject. Now we may add that the becoming takes place, as it were, on two 
different levels, which correspond to the two levels of potentiality and the 
related dynamisms. First, there is the becoming of man at the somato-vegetative 
level. During all life the human organism undergoes change: first there is 
growth and development, then come exhaustion and gradual dying away. These 
changes are visible with the naked eye. But our knowledge of the human organism 
allows a much more precise definition of its becoming when connected with the 
potentiality and the dynamism at the somato-vegetative level. We know, for 
instance, that the physicochemical composition of all tissue cells is completely 
exchanged every few years. The natural activities of the organism consist not 
only in self-sustenance but also in permanent reconstruction. We do not need, 
however, to go into such details here, this being the task of the particular 
sciences. Our main question is not how the organism is built, which in itself is 
highly interesting, but how it is integrated in the person and how the dynamism 
proper to it is integrated in the actions of a person, in the conscious acting 
of man.<SUP>37</SUP> </P>
<P align=justify>Let us now turn to the psychoemotive dynamism and the level of 
the human potentiality at which it develops in the man-subject. Also at this 
level there is a corresponding specific type of becoming, a becoming and 
psychical development of man. We may think of it and discuss it by analogy with 
the becoming of the human organism. An attempt to comprehend the psychoemotive 
type of becoming of man will be made later in a separate chapter. At present it 
suffices to say that both kinds of becoming - one connected with the vegetative 
potentiality and dynamism of the organism, and the other with the psychoemotive 
potentiality and its corresponding dynamism - depend on a certain passiveness in 
man. It is the kind of passiveness pertaining only to that which happens in man 
and to that which we see in the causation of nature itself and not to that 
conscious efficacy which involves the causation of the person. In this 
connection, however, we have to note at once that the manner in which the 
vegetative dynamism remains receptive and accessible to conscious influence 
differs entirely from that of emotive dynamism. The human organism determines 
almost entirely its own development, and only the conditions of the development 
are established by man. The situation is the opposite in the psychoemotive 
sphere, which itself establishes the conditions and, as it were, supplies the 
material for its own development; consequently, the formation of this sphere 
mainly depends on the human person.</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Actions Make Man Good or Bad</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>The formation of the psychoemotive sphere brings us to that 
aspect of the type of becoming human which will next receive our attention. It 
is man's actions, his conscious acting, that make of him <I>what </I>and <I>who 
</I>he actually is. This form of the human becoming thus presupposes the 
efficacy or causation proper to man. It is morality that is the fruit, the 
homogenetic effect of the causation of the personal ego, but morality conceived 
not in the abstract but as a strictly existential reality pertaining to the 
person who is its own proper subject. It is man's actions, the way he 
consciously acts, that make of him a good or a bad man - good or bad in the 
moral sense. To be "morally good" means to be good as a man. To be "morally bad" 
means to be bad as a man. Whether a man, because of his actions, becomes morally 
better or morally worse depends on the nature and modalities of actions. The 
qualitative moments and virtualities of actions, inasmuch as they refer to the 
moral norm and ultimately to the dictates of the conscience, are imprinted upon 
man by his performing the action.</P>
<P align=justify>The becoming of man in his moral aspect that is strictly 
connected with the person is <I>the </I>decisive factor in determining the 
concrete realistic character of goodness and badness, of the moral values 
themselves as concretized in human acting. Without in any way constituting the 
content of consciousness itself they belong integrally to the personal, human 
becoming. Man not only concretizes them in action and experiences them but 
because of them he himself, as a being, actually becomes good or bad. Moral 
conduct partakes of the reality of human actions as expressing a specific type 
and line of becoming of the man-subject, the type of becoming that is most 
intrinsically related to his nature, that is, his humanness, and to the fact of 
his being a person.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><B><I>
<P align=justify>Freedom Is the Root of Man's Goodness or Badness</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>When we search deep into the integral structure of moral 
conduct and becoming, into the integral structure of man's becoming morally good 
or morally bad, we find in it the proper moment of freedom. It is in the 
structure of man's becoming, through his actions, morally good or bad, that 
freedom manifests itself~ most appropriately. Here, however, freedom is not only 
a moment; it also forms a real and inherent component of the structure, indeed, 
a component that is decisive for the entire structure of moral becoming: freedom 
constitutes the root factor of man's becoming good or bad by his actions; it is 
the root factor of the becoming as such of human morality. It also takes place 
in efficacy and thus plays a decisive role in man's acting. By being interwoven 
with efficacy, freedom and efficacy together determine not only acting or action 
itself, which are performed by the personal ego, but their moral goodness or 
badness, that is to say, the becoming of man morally good or bad as 
man.</P></FONT><FONT face=Verdana>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P align=justify>The Moment of Freedom Emerges from the Analysis of Human 
Dynamism. Freedom and Efficacy of the Person</P></b></I>
<P align=justify>It is by means of the moral value which man crystallizes 
through actions as enhancing his own being that these actions, or man's 
conscious acting, are brought down to the exercise of the moment of freedom. 
This freedom is best visualized by the human being in the experience aptly 
epitomized in the phrase, "I may but I need not." It is not so much a matter of 
the content of consciousness alone as of a manifestation and actualization of 
the dynamism proper to a man. This dynamism is in the line of acting, and it is 
along this line that it becomes part of the efficacy of the personal ego but 
remains distinct from all that only happens in man. The manifestation and 
actualization of the dynamism proper to man must have its correlate in the 
potentiality of the man-subject. We call the correlate the <I>will. </I>Between 
the "I may" on the one hand and, on the other, the "I need not," the human "I 
want" is formed, and it constitutes the dynamism proper to the will. The will is 
what in man allows him to want.</P>
<P align=justify>The identification of freedom as the decisive moment of the 
experience of efficacy and at the same time as the factor that, on the one hand, 
actually constitutes the structure of "man-acts" and, on the other, 
distinguishes it structurally from all that only happens in man (from the 
structure of "something-happens-in-man") brings to a conclusion the present 
stage of our investigations into the dynamism of the human person. For it is the 
person that is the real subject of the dynamism - and so far as acting is 
concerned not just the subject but also the actor. The discovery of freedom at 
the root of the efficacy of the person allows us to reach an even more 
fundamental understanding of man as the dynamic subject. Conformably with our 
basic experience the totality of the dynamism proper to man is divisible into 
acting and happening (actions and activations). This distinction rests on the 
difference between the real participation of the will, as in conscious acting or 
actions, and the absence of the will. What happens only in man has no dynamic 
source; it lacks the element of freedom and the experience of "I may but I need 
not." In the perspective of the person and of his proper dynamism, that is, as 
dynamized by action, everything that happens in man is seen to be dynamized out 
of inner necessity without the participation of the moral becoming of man free 
from constraints, in this dynamism; the moment of the dynamic transcendence is 
lacking however; the moment of freedom is immanent to the conditions of man's 
moral becoming and connected with the causation by nature. Action proper, on the 
other hand, exhibits - owing to the causation by the person -the transcending 
feature that passes into the immanence of the acting process itself: for acting 
also consists in the dynamization of the subject. The dynamic transcendence of 
the person is itself based on freedom, which is lacking in the causation of 
nature.</P></FONT>
