No weakness of human nature is more universal and conspicuous than what we commonly
call Credulity, or a too easy faith in the testimony of others; and this weakness is
also very naturally accounted for from the influence of resemblance. When we receive
any matter of fact upon human testimony, our faith arises from the very same origin as
our inferences from causes to effects, and from effects to causes; nor is there any
thing but our experience of the governing principles of human nature, which can give us
any assurance of the veracity of men. But thoâ€™ experience be the true standard of this,
as well as of all other judgments, we seldom regulate ourselves entirely by it; but
have a remarkable propensity to believe whatever is reported, even concerning
apparitions, enchantments, and prodigies, however contrary to daily experience and
observation
